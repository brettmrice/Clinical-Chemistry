Understanding the biochemical roles of vitamins and their metabolic pathways is critical for appreciating their impact on health and disease

## **General Principles of Vitamin Metabolism** {-}

*   **Vitamins as Essential Nutrients**
    *   Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for human health but cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by the body
    *   They must be obtained from dietary sources or supplements
*   **Classification of Vitamins**
    *   **Water-Soluble Vitamins:** B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folate, cobalamin) and vitamin C
    *   **Fat-Soluble Vitamins:** Vitamins A, D, E, and K
*   **General Metabolic Functions**
    *   **Coenzymes:** Many vitamins act as coenzymes, which are essential for the activity of enzymes involved in metabolic reactions
    *   **Antioxidants:** Some vitamins act as antioxidants, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals
    *   **Hormone-Like Functions:** Some vitamins have hormone-like functions, regulating gene expression and cell differentiation
    *   **Other Functions:** Some vitamins are involved in vision, blood clotting, and immune function
*   **Absorption and Transport**
    *   **Water-Soluble Vitamins:** Absorbed directly into the bloodstream
    *   **Fat-Soluble Vitamins:** Absorbed along with dietary fats, requiring bile acids and pancreatic enzymes
    *   **Transport:** Vitamins are transported in the bloodstream either freely or bound to carrier proteins
*   **Storage and Excretion**
    *   **Water-Soluble Vitamins:** Not stored in the body to a significant extent; excess is excreted in the urine
    *   **Fat-Soluble Vitamins:** Stored in the liver and adipose tissue; excess can lead to toxicity
*   **Deficiency and Toxicity**
    *   **Vitamin Deficiency:** Occurs when intake is inadequate, leading to impaired metabolic functions and specific deficiency symptoms
    *   **Vitamin Toxicity:** Occurs when intake is excessive, leading to adverse effects
