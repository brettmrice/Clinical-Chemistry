    *   Biohazardous Waste: Dispose of biohazardous waste properly
*   **Documentation**
    *   Record all procedures, results, and quality control data accurately and completely
    *   Maintain a log of instrument maintenance and calibrations
*   **Security**
    *   Store controlled substances securely
    *   Limit access to the toxicology laboratory

## **Specimen Collection and Processing** {-}

*   **General Considerations**
    *   Sample Integrity: Collect specimens in appropriate containers to prevent contamination or degradation
    *   Volume: Collect adequate volume for testing and potential reanalysis
    *   Timeliness: Process specimens promptly to minimize changes in analyte concentrations
*   **Specific Specimen Types**
    *   Blood:
        *   Collect in appropriate tubes (e.g., gray-top tubes for alcohol analysis)
        *   Avoid hemolysis
        *   Separate plasma or serum from cells promptly
    *   Urine:
        *   Collect a random or timed urine sample
        *   Use appropriate containers with preservatives, if necessary
    *   Gastric Contents:
        *   Collect as soon as possible after ingestion
        *   Record the volume and appearance of the gastric contents
    *   Tissues:
        *   Collect tissue samples during autopsy or biopsy
        *   Store in appropriate containers at -20°C or -80°C
    *   Hair:
        *   Collect hair samples close to the scalp
        *   Wash and segment the hair before analysis
    *   Oral Fluid:
        *   Collect using a specialized collection device
        *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for collection and storage

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Unexpected Results**
    *   Verify the patient identification
    *   Repeat the test to confirm the result
    *   Check for interfering substances
    *   Review the patient's medical history and medication list
    *   Consider alternative analytical methods
*   **Quality Control Failures**
    *   Out-of-Range QC: Investigate and correct the cause of the failure
    *   Calibration Issues: Check calibration standards and recalibrate the instrument
    *   Reagent Problems: Verify reagent integrity, storage conditions, and expiration dates
    *   Instrument Malfunction: Troubleshoot and repair the instrument
*   **Interferences**
    *   Identify the interfering substance
    *   Use appropriate methods to minimize or eliminate the interference
    *   Consider using an alternative analytical method

## **Common Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Endogenous Substances**
    *   Bilirubin: Can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   Lipids: Can cause turbidity and affect immunoassays
    *   Proteins: Can interfere with chromatography and mass spectrometry
*   **Exogenous Substances**
    *   Medications: Many drugs can interfere with toxicology assays
    *   Herbal Supplements: Can contain compounds that interfere with assays
    *   Food: Can affect the absorption and metabolism of drugs
    *   Cleaning Agents: Can contaminate specimens and affect results
*   **Collection and Handling Materials**
    *   Tube Additives: Can interfere with assays
    *   Contaminated Containers: Can introduce interfering substances
*   **Specific Interferences**
    *   Cross-Reactivity: Antibodies may bind to multiple compounds
    *   Matrix Effects: Components in the sample matrix can affect results
    *   Heterophile Antibodies: Can cause falsely high or low results

## **Specific Strategies for Addressing Interferences** {-}

*   **Dilution:** Dilute the sample to reduce the concentration of the interfering substance
*   **Extraction:** Use liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction (SPE) to remove interfering substances
*   **Cleanup Procedures:** Employ cleanup procedures to remove interfering substances
*   **Masking Agents:** Add masking agents to bind to interfering substances and prevent them from interfering with the assay
*   **Alternate Methods:** Use a different analytical method that is less susceptible to the interference
*   **Interference Checks:** Implement interference checks to assess the impact of potential interfering substances

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Calibration:** Adjusting an instrument to ensure accurate readings
*   **Chain of Custody:** Documentation of the handling of a specimen
*   **Control:** A sample with a known result that is run as a reference point
*   **Heterophile Antibodies:** Human antibodies that can bind to animal antibodies
*   **Interfering Substance:** A component which affects test measurements
*   **Matrix Effects:** The combined effect of all sample components other than the analyte
*   **Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE):** Provides safety for laboratory staff
*   **Preservative:** Chemical added to maintain stability
*   **Quality Control (QC):** Testing the process by which results are created
*   **Toxicology:** Branch of science concerned with nature, effects, and detection of poisons
