# Physiology {-}

Endocrine disorders are abnormal states that arise from either hormone excess or deficiency. Understanding what constitutes a normal hormonal balance is crucial for identifying and interpreting abnormal states

## **Normal Endocrine Function** {-}

*   **Hormone Synthesis and Secretion**
    *   **Synthesis:** Hormones are synthesized in endocrine glands through various biochemical pathways, often involving enzymatic reactions and precursor molecules
    *   **Secretion:** Hormone secretion is regulated by feedback mechanisms, neural signals, and hormonal signals to maintain homeostasis
*   **Hormone Transport**
    *   **Protein Binding:** Many hormones are transported in the bloodstream bound to carrier proteins, which protect them from degradation and prolong their half-life
    *   **Free Hormone:** Only the free (unbound) hormone is biologically active and can interact with target tissues
*   **Hormone Action**
    *   **Receptor Binding:** Hormones bind to specific receptors on target cells, initiating intracellular signaling cascades
    *   **Signal Transduction:** These cascades alter cellular function, gene expression, and protein synthesis to produce physiological effects
*   **Hormone Metabolism and Excretion**
    *   **Metabolism:** Hormones are metabolized in the liver, kidneys, and other tissues to inactive forms
    *   **Excretion:** Metabolites are excreted in the urine or bile
*   **Feedback Mechanisms**
    *   **Negative Feedback:** Hormone levels are tightly regulated by negative feedback loops, where the hormone's effects inhibit its own secretion
    *   **Positive Feedback:** In some cases, hormones can stimulate their own secretion, leading to a surge in hormone levels (e.g., during ovulation)

##  **Abnormal Endocrine Function** {-}

*   **Hormone Excess**
    *   **Causes:** Tumors, autoimmune disorders, ectopic hormone production
    *   **Effects:** Exaggerated physiological responses, metabolic imbalances, organ damage
*   **Hormone Deficiency**
    *   **Causes:** Autoimmune destruction, surgical removal, genetic defects, infections
    *   **Effects:** Impaired physiological responses, metabolic abnormalities, developmental issues
*   **Receptor Abnormalities**
    *   **Receptor Resistance:** Target tissues fail to respond normally to hormones due to receptor defects or post-receptor signaling abnormalities
    *   **Receptor Mutations:** Genetic mutations can alter receptor structure and function, leading to hormone resistance or constitutive activation
*   **Ectopic Hormone Production**
    *   **Non-Endocrine Tumors:** Some tumors can produce hormones that are not normally secreted by that tissue, leading to hormonal imbalances
    *   **Paraneoplastic Syndromes:** These syndromes can cause a wide range of endocrine and metabolic abnormalities

## **Specific Endocrine Disorders** {-}

### **Pituitary Disorders**
*   **Hyperpituitarism (Hormone Excess)**
    *   **Acromegaly:** Excess growth hormone (GH) leads to enlarged hands, feet, and facial features
    *   **Cushing's Disease:** Excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) leads to excess cortisol production, causing weight gain, hypertension, and muscle weakness
