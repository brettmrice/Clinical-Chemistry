# Principles {-}

Understanding the analytical principles behind immunoassays and chromatography is essential for accurate and reliable therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

## **Immunoassays in TDM** {-}

*   **Principle:** Immunoassays rely on the specific binding of an antibody to its target antigen (the drug being measured)
*   **Types of Immunoassays**
    *   **Competitive Immunoassay:** Unlabeled drug in the sample competes with labeled drug for binding to a limited number of antibodies
    *   **Non-Competitive Immunoassay:** Antibodies are in excess, and the amount of antibody-drug complex formed is directly proportional to the drug concentration
    *   **Homogeneous Immunoassay:** Antibody-antigen binding directly alters the signal without the need for separation steps
    *   **Heterogeneous Immunoassay:** Requires separation of bound and unbound antibody-antigen complexes before signal detection
*   **Components**
    *   **Antibody:** A protein produced by the immune system that specifically binds to the target drug (antigen)
    *   **Antigen (Drug):** The drug being measured in the sample
    *   **Label:** A molecule attached to the antibody or antigen to allow for detection
    *   **Detection System:** Measures the amount of label bound to the antibody-antigen complex
*   **Common Immunoassay Formats in TDM**
    *   **Enzyme-Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT):** A homogeneous competitive immunoassay
    *   **Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA):** A homogeneous competitive immunoassay that measures changes in polarized light
    *   **Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA):** A heterogeneous non-competitive immunoassay using chemiluminescent labels
*   **Applications in TDM**
    *   Measurement of a wide range of drugs, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, cardioactive drugs, immunosuppressants, and antidepressants

### **Enzyme-Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT)** {-}

*   **Principle:** A homogeneous competitive immunoassay that uses an enzyme label
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Antibody and Enzyme-Labeled Drug: A fixed amount of antibody specific to the drug and a fixed amount of drug labeled with an active enzyme are mixed with the patient sample
    2.  Competition: If the drug is present in the patient sample, it competes with the enzyme-labeled drug for binding to the antibody
    3.  Enzyme Activity: The amount of enzyme-labeled drug that binds to the antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of the drug in the patient sample. The enzyme activity is measured by adding a substrate that is converted to a detectable product
*   **Advantages:** Rapid, simple, automated, and cost-effective
*   **Limitations:** Less sensitive and specific compared to chromatographic methods; susceptible to interferences

### **Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA)** {-}

*   **Principle:** A homogeneous competitive immunoassay that measures changes in polarized light
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Antibody and Fluorescently-Labeled Drug: A fixed amount of antibody specific to the drug and a fixed amount of drug labeled with a fluorophore are mixed with the patient sample
    2.  Polarization: When the labeled drug is free in solution, it rotates rapidly, resulting in low polarization of the emitted light. When the labeled drug binds to the antibody, the resulting complex rotates more slowly, resulting in increased polarization of the emitted light
    3.  Polarization Measurement: The degree of polarization is inversely proportional to the concentration of the drug in the patient sample
*   **Advantages:** Automated, relatively high throughput, and less susceptible to interferences compared to EMIT
*   **Limitations:** Lower sensitivity and specificity compared to chromatographic methods

### **Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA)** {-}

*   **Principle:** A heterogeneous non-competitive immunoassay using chemiluminescent labels
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Antibody-Coated Microparticles: The patient sample is incubated with antibody-coated microparticles that capture the drug
    2.  Washing: Unbound substances are washed away
    3.  Chemiluminescent-Labeled Antibody: A chemiluminescent-labeled antibody specific to the drug is added, which binds to the drug captured by the microparticles
    4.  Chemiluminescent Reaction: A chemiluminescent substrate is added, and the emitted light is measured
*   **Advantages:** High sensitivity and specificity, automated, and relatively high throughput
*   **Limitations:** More complex than homogeneous immunoassays and requires separation steps

## **Chromatography in TDM** {-}

*   **Principle:** Chromatography is a separation technique used to separate and quantify individual compounds in a complex mixture based on their physical and chemical properties
*   **Types of Chromatography**
    *   **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):** Uses a liquid mobile phase and a solid stationary phase to separate compounds
    *   **Gas Chromatography (GC):** Uses a gaseous mobile phase and a solid or liquid stationary phase to separate volatile compounds
    *   **Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS):** Combines the separation capabilities of HPLC with the detection power of mass spectrometry
    *   **Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS):** Combines the separation capabilities of GC with the detection power of mass spectrometry
*   **Components**
    *   **Mobile Phase:** A liquid or gas that carries the sample through the chromatography system
    *   **Stationary Phase:** A solid or liquid material that interacts with the sample components, causing them to separate
    *   **Column:** Contains the stationary phase
    *   **Detector:** Detects the separated compounds as they elute from the column
*   **Detection Methods**
    *   **UV-Vis Detection:** Measures the absorbance of compounds at specific wavelengths
    *   **Fluorescence Detection:** Measures the fluorescence of compounds after excitation with light
    *   **Electrochemical Detection:** Measures the oxidation or reduction of compounds
    *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** Measures the mass-to-charge ratio of compounds
*   **Applications in TDM**
    *   Measurement of drugs that are not easily measured by immunoassays
    *   Separation and quantification of multiple drugs or metabolites in a single sample
    *   Confirmation of immunoassay results
    *   Detection of drug metabolites
    *   Accurate measurement of Free Drug (HPLC-UF)
