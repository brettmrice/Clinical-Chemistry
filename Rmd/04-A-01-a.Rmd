Hormones act as key regulators of numerous metabolic pathways in the body. Understanding how hormones influence these pathways is crucial for understanding endocrine disorders

## **Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism** {-}

*   **Hormones:** Chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands that travel through the bloodstream to target cells, where they elicit specific physiological effects
