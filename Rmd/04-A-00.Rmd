This section covers the biochemical basis, testing methods, interpretation of results, and associations with different disease states associated with endocrinology

## **Biochemical Theory and Pathways** {-}

*   **Hormones as Messengers**
    *   Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, and stress response
*   **Hormone Synthesis, Secretion, and Transport**
    *   Hormones are synthesized in endocrine glands and secreted into the bloodstream in response to specific stimuli
    *   They are transported either freely or bound to carrier proteins
*   **Mechanisms of Action**
    *   Hormones bind to specific receptors on target cells, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that alter gene expression and cellular function
    *   Receptors can be located on the cell surface (peptide hormones and catecholamines) or within the cell (steroid hormones and thyroid hormones)
*   **Key Hormones and Their Functions**
    *   **Pituitary Hormones:** Growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
    *   **Thyroid Hormones:** Thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3)
    *   **Adrenal Hormones:** Cortisol, aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine
    *   **Pancreatic Hormones:** Insulin, glucagon
    *   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)**
    *   **Gonadal Hormones:** Testosterone, estradiol, progesterone
*   **Feedback Mechanisms**
    *   Hormone levels are tightly regulated by negative feedback loops to maintain homeostasis

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Principles of Hormone Measurement**
    *   Immunoassays: Based on antibody-antigen interactions (e.g., ELISA, CLIA, RIA)
    *   Fluorescence Assays: Measure the intensity of emitted light from fluorescently labeled hormones
    *   Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS): Separates and quantifies hormones based on their mass-to-charge ratio
*   **Specimen Collection and Handling**
    *   Follow specific guidelines for patient preparation, collection tubes, order of draw, and specimen processing to ensure accurate results
*   **Stimulation/Suppression Tests**
    *   Used to assess the functional reserve of endocrine glands and diagnose hormone excess or deficiency
    *   Involve administration of stimulatory or suppressive agents and serial hormone measurements
*   **Common Tests**
    *   Pituitary: GH, ACTH, TSH, prolactin, LH, FSH
    *   Thyroid: Free T4, Free T3, TSH, thyroid antibodies
    *   Adrenal: Cortisol, aldosterone, catecholamines
    *   Parathyroid: PTH, calcium, vitamin D
    *   Gonadal: Testosterone, estradiol, progesterone
    *   Other: Insulin, C-peptide, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Use appropriate reference intervals for the specific assay and patient population
*   **Clinical Context**
    *   Interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and other laboratory data
*   **Multiple Tests**
    *   Assess the pattern of hormone levels rather than relying on a single value; dynamic tests may be needed
*   **Interfering Substances**
    *   Be aware of potential interfering substances that can affect hormone measurements
*   **Assay Limitations**
    *   Understand the limitations of the specific assay used, including its sensitivity, specificity, and potential for cross-reactivity
*   **Common Findings**
    *   Elevated or suppressed hormone levels
    *   Abnormal responses to stimulation/suppression tests
    *   Presence of hormone-specific antibodies

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Pituitary Disorders**
    *   Acromegaly/Gigantism: Elevated GH and IGF-1
    *   Cushing's Disease: Elevated cortisol and ACTH
    *   Hypopituitarism: Deficiencies in one or more pituitary hormones
*   **Thyroid Disorders**
    *   Hyperthyroidism: Suppressed TSH and elevated free T4 and/or free T3
    *   Hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH and low free T4
*   **Adrenal Disorders**
    *   Cushing's Syndrome: Elevated cortisol levels
    *   Addison's Disease (Primary Adrenal Insufficiency): Low cortisol and elevated ACTH
    *   Pheochromocytoma: Elevated catecholamines and metanephrines
*   **Parathyroid Disorders**
    *   Hyperparathyroidism: Elevated calcium and PTH
    *   Hypoparathyroidism: Low calcium and PTH
*   **Gonadal Disorders**
    *   Hypogonadism in Males: Low testosterone and elevated LH/FSH (primary) or low LH/FSH (secondary)
    *   Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Elevated testosterone, LH/FSH ratio, and insulin resistance
*   **Other Hormones**
    *   Diabetes Mellitus: Elevated glucose and HbA1c, variable insulin and C-peptide
    *   Pregnancy: Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
