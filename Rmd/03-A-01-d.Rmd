# Physiology {-}

Maintaining the proper balance of acids and bases in the body is crucial for sustaining life. Disruptions to this balance can lead to various life-threatening conditions, including acidosis and alkalosis. Understanding the causes and effects of acid-base imbalances is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. Effective management of acid-base disorders requires addressing the underlying cause and restoring normal pH, oxygenation, and ventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis provides essential information for assessing acid-base status and guiding therapy
