# Therapeutic Drug Monitoring {-}

This section provides a comprehensive overview of TDM

## **Pharmacokinetics (PK)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The study of how the body affects a drug after administration (ADME)
*   **ADME Processes**
    *   Absorption: Entry of drug into the bloodstream
    *   Distribution: Transport of drug to tissues
    *   Metabolism: Chemical alteration of drug
    *   Excretion: Elimination of drug and metabolites
*   **Key PK Parameters**
    *   Bioavailability: Fraction of drug reaching systemic circulation
    *   Volume of Distribution (Vd): Apparent space in the body available to contain the drug
    *   Clearance (CL): Rate of drug removal from the body
    *   Half-Life (t1/2): Time for drug concentration to decrease by half
*   **Therapeutic Range**
    *   The range of drug concentrations associated with optimal therapeutic effect and minimal toxicity
*   **Therapeutic States**
    *   Subtherapeutic: Below therapeutic range
    *   Therapeutic: Within therapeutic range
    *   Toxic: Above therapeutic range
    *   Supratherapeutic: Above therapeutic range

## **Chemical and Physical Properties** {-}

*   **Importance:** Properties influence ADME, mechanism of action, and analytical methods
*   **Key Properties**
    *   Solubility: Affects absorption and excretion
    *   Ionization: Influences absorption, distribution, and renal excretion
    *   Protein Binding: Affects distribution and free drug concentration
    *   Partition Coefficient (Log P): Affects membrane permeability
*   **Drug Classes and Properties**
    *   Aminoglycosides: Water-soluble, polycationic
    *   Cardioactive Drugs: Variable properties
    *   Anticonvulsants: Lipid-soluble
    *   Antidepressants: Variable properties
    *   Immunosuppressants: Lipid-soluble, highly protein-bound

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Analytical Principles**
    *   Immunoassays: Antibody-antigen binding
    *   Chromatography: Separates compounds
    *   Mass Spectrometry: Measures mass-to-charge ratio
*   **Specimen Collection and Handling**
    *   Timing of Dose: Trough, peak
    *   Collection Tubes: Correct type to minimize interference
    *   Processing: Centrifugation, separation, storage
*   **Quality Control**
    *   Use QC samples to validate accuracy
    *   Calibrate instruments routinely

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Use appropriate reference ranges
*   **Clinical Context**
    *   Patient history, symptoms, medication list
*   **Influence of Other Variables**
    *   Drug-drug interactions
    *   Age, Weight, etc
*   **Common Findings**
    *   Drug level results below, above, or within the therapeutic range
*   **Limitations**
    *   Consider test specificity

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Renal Disease:** Affects excretion
*   **Liver Disease:** Affects metabolism
*   **Heart Failure:** Affects distribution
*   **Gastrointestinal Disorders:** Affects absorption
*   **Obesity:** Alters distribution
*   **Pregnancy:** Alters all ADME phases
*   **Other Correlations**
    *   Other diseases or conditions that may alter the distribution, metabolization, and excretion
