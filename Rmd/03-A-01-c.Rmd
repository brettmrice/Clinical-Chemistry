# CO<sub>2</sub> & O<sub>2</sub> Transport {-}

Oxygen and carbon dioxide transport are essential processes for maintaining life. Oxygen, vital for cellular respiration, is primarily transported by hemoglobin within red blood cells, with a small fraction dissolved in plasma. Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is influenced by factors like pH, $CO_2$, temperature, and 2,3-BPG, as reflected in the oxygen dissociation curve. 

Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of metabolism, is transported in three forms: dissolved in plasma, bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin, and predominantly as bicarbonate ions. The conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase within red blood cells, while the chloride shift maintains electrical neutrality during this process. These intricate mechanisms ensure efficient gas exchange, supporting cellular function and overall homeostasis

*   **Oxygen in the Blood**
    *   Dissolved Oxygen: A small amount of oxygen is dissolved directly in the plasma
        *   Approximately 1.5-3% of total oxygen in the blood
        *   Determines the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa$O_2$)

        *   Each hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules
        *   The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is reversible
*   **Hemoglobin Structure**
    *   Tetrameric protein consisting of four polypeptide chains (globins): two alpha (α) chains and two beta (β) chains
    *   Each globin chain is associated with a heme group, which contains an iron ($Fe^{2+}$) atom
    *   The iron atom binds oxygen reversibly
*   **Oxygen Binding to Hemoglobin**
    *   Oxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin bound to oxygen (Hb$O_2$)
    *   Deoxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin not bound to oxygen (Hb)
    *   Cooperative Binding: The binding of the first oxygen molecule to hemoglobin increases the affinity of hemoglobin for subsequent oxygen molecules
    *   Sigmoidal Oxygen Dissociation Curve: Reflects the cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin
*   **Oxygen Dissociation Curve**
    *   Definition: A graph that plots the percentage of hemoglobin saturation (Sa$O_2$) against the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa$O_2$)
    *   Shape: Sigmoidal (S-shaped)
    *   P50: The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated
        *   Normal P50: Approximately 27 mmHg
        *   Shift to the Right: Decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (increased P50)
            *   Caused by increased temperature, increased Pa$CO_2$, decreased pH, increased 2,3-BPG
        *   Shift to the Left: Increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (decreased P50)
            *   Caused by decreased temperature, decreased Pa$CO_2$, increased pH, decreased 2,3-BPG

*   **Factors Affecting Oxygen Binding**
    *   pH (Bohr Effect):
        *   Decreased pH (increased acidity) decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the right
        *   Increased pH (decreased acidity) increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the left
    *   Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):
        *   Increased Pa$CO_2$ decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the right
        *   Decreased Pa$CO_2$ increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the left
    *   Temperature:
        *   Increased temperature decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the right
        *   Decreased temperature increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the left
    *   2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG):
        *   Increased 2,3-BPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the right
        *   Decreased 2,3-BPG increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the curve to the left
        *   2,3-BPG binds to deoxyhemoglobin and stabilizes its conformation, reducing oxygen affinity

## **Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) Transport** {-}

    *   Catalyzed by Carbonic Anhydrase: An enzyme present in red blood cells that greatly accelerates the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate
*   **Chloride Shift**
    *   Process: Bicarbonate ions ($HCO_3^-$) diffuse out of red blood cells into the plasma, and chloride ions ($Cl^-$) move into the red blood cells to maintain electrical neutrality
    *   Reversal: In the lungs, the process is reversed: bicarbonate ions move back into the red blood cells, chloride ions move out, and carbon dioxide is released and exhaled
