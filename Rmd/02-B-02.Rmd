# Procedures {-}

Understanding the principles and procedures for testing proteins and nitrogen compounds is key to clinical diagnosis. Proper technique and careful attention to detail will produce accurate and reliable data

## **Principles of Laboratory Tests** {-}

Tests measure the levels of proteins and nitrogen-containing compounds in bodily fluids, using a variety of chemical and immunochemical techniques

*   **Total Protein:** Biuret reaction (measures peptide bonds)
*   **Albumin:** Dye-binding methods (Bromcresol Green or Bromcresol Purple)
*   **Prealbumin:** Immunochemical Methods
*   **Globulins:** Calculated (Total Protein - Albumin)
*   **Urea (BUN):** Enzymatic (urease) or direct chemical methods
*   **Creatinine:** Jaffe reaction or enzymatic methods
*   **Uric Acid:** Enzymatic (uricase) or chemical methods
*   **Ammonia:** Enzymatic or ion-selective electrode (ISE) methods
*   **CSF Protein:** Biuret or dye-binding methods
*   **Urine Protein:** Turbidimetric or dye-binding methods
*   **Protein Electrophoresis:** Separates proteins by charge/size
*   **Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE):** Identifies monoclonal proteins
*   **Tumor Markers:** Immunoassays
*   **Cardiac Markers:** Immunoassays

## **Special Precautions** {-}

Patient preparation and handling the specimens correctly are the groundwork for reliable results

*   **Patient Preparation:** Fasting, medication review, hydration status, posture
*   **Specimen Collection**
    *   Correct specimen and tube type
    *   Proper order of draw
    *   Minimize tourniquet time
    *   Clean venipuncture technique
*   **Specimen Handling and Processing**
    *   Process specimens promptly
    *   Proper centrifugation techniques
    *   Appropriate storage conditions (temperature, light exposure)
*   **Analytical Considerations**
    *   Reagent Quality: Check expiration dates and storage conditions
    *   Calibration: Use appropriate standards and calibrate regularly
    *   Quality Control (QC): Run controls regularly, evaluate results
    *   Instrumentation: Proper instrument maintenance and function

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

Recognizing what causes errors will ensure the accuracy of measurements

*   **High or Low Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical: Patient factors, collection/processing errors
    *   Analytical: Reagents, calibration, interferences, instrument malfunction
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Review patient preparation
    *   Check collection, processing, reagents, calibration
    *   Consider interfering substances
    *   Repeat the test, use a different method
*   **Out-of-Control QC**
    *   Check QC materials, reagents, calibration
    *   Repeat QC testing
    *   Contact manufacturer if problem persists

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

Endogenous substances or exogenous contaminants can throw off lab results. Being aware of potential interferences can minimize error

*   **Endogenous:** Lipemia, hemolysis, bilirubin, high protein concentrations
*   **Exogenous:** Medications, anticoagulants, contaminants
*   **Minimizing Interferences**
    *   Use methods less susceptible to interference
    *   Employ techniques to remove or correct for interferences
    *   Dilute the sample (if appropriate)
    *   Use blanking or background subtraction
    
## **Clearances** {-}

Clearance tests measure the rate at which a substance is removed from blood by the kidneys, reflecting kidney function

*   **Creatinine Clearance**
    *   Collection: 24-hour urine collection, serum sample
    *   Principle: Measures the rate at which creatinine is removed from the blood by the kidneys
    *   Formula: C = (U x V) / P
    *   Estimating GFR: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Equations
*   **Urea Clearance**
    *   Urine is collected for one hour
    *   Urea concentrations are measured to determine kidney function
