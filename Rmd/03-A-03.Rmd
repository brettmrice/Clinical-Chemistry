## **Step-by-Step Interpretation** {-}

1.  Examine the pH:
    *   Is the pH within the normal range (7.35-7.45)?
    *   If not, is it acidemic (< 7.35) or alkalemic (> 7.45)?

2.  Evaluate the Respiratory Component (Pa$CO_2$):
    *   Is the Pa$CO_2$ within the normal range (35-45 mmHg)?
    *   If not, is it elevated (> 45 mmHg, indicating respiratory acidosis) or decreased (< 35 mmHg, indicating respiratory alkalosis)?

3.  Assess the Metabolic Component ($HCO_3^-$):
    *   Is the $HCO_3^-$ within the normal range (22-26 mEq/L)?
    *   If not, is it decreased (< 22 mEq/L, indicating metabolic acidosis) or elevated (> 26 mEq/L, indicating metabolic alkalosis)?

4.  Determine the Primary Disorder:
    *   Match the pH abnormality with the corresponding primary disturbance:
        *   Acidemia + Elevated Pa$CO_2$: Respiratory Acidosis
        *   Acidemia + Decreased $HCO_3^-$: Metabolic Acidosis
        *   Alkalemia + Decreased Pa$CO_2$: Respiratory Alkalosis
        *   Alkalemia + Elevated $HCO_3^-$: Metabolic Alkalosis

5.  Evaluate Compensation:
    *   Is there evidence of compensation by the other system?
    *   Respiratory Compensation: The lungs will try to compensate for metabolic disorders by adjusting the Pa$CO_2$
    *   Renal Compensation: The kidneys will try to compensate for respiratory disorders by adjusting the $HCO_3^-$
    *   Compensation is present if the non-causative parameter is also abnormal

6.  Assess Oxygenation:
    *   Is the Pa$O_2$ within the normal range (80-100 mmHg)?
    *   Is the Sa$O_2$ within the normal range (95-100%)?
    *   If not, is there evidence of hypoxemia?

7.  Calculate Anion Gap (if Metabolic Acidosis is present):
    *   Anion Gap = [$Na^+$] + [$K^+$] - [$Cl^-$] - [$HCO_3^-$]
    *   Normal Anion Gap: 8-16 mEq/L (with $K^+$), 10-20 mEq/L (without $K^+$)
    *   Elevated Anion Gap: Suggests the presence of unmeasured acids (e.g., ketoacids, lactic acid)

8.  Determine if Expected Compensation is Appropriate:
    *   Once the primary disorder is determined, calculate the "expected" range for the compensating parameter
    *   If the measured value doesn't fall in that range, there may be a mixed acid-base disorder

## **Acid-Base Disorders** {-}

    *   Causes: Hypoventilation due to COPD, drug overdose, neuromuscular disorders

    *   Assess Anion Gap: To determine the cause of metabolic acidosis

## **Compensation** {-}

    *   Expected Pa$CO_2$ = 1.5 x [$HCO_3^-$] + 8 ± 2
*   Respiratory Compensation for Metabolic Alkalosis
    *   Expected Pa$CO_2$ = 0.7 x [$HCO_3^-$] + 20 ± 5

    *   Chronic: $HCO_3^-$ increases by 3.5 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg increase in Pa$CO_2$
*   Metabolic Compensation for Respiratory Alkalosis
    *   Acute: $HCO_3^-$ decreases by 2 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg decrease in Pa$CO_2$
