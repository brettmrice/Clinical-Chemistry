# Calculations {-}

These formulas are vital for assessing fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as identifying underlying metabolic disturbances

## **Osmolality** {-}

*   **Definition:** A measure of the concentration of solute particles in a solution. It reflects the number of dissolved particles per kilogram of solvent (water)
*   **Units:** milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg) or millimoles per kilogram (mmol/kg)
*   **Measured Osmolality:** Determined using an osmometer, which measures colligative properties of the solution (e.g., freezing point depression or vapor pressure depression)
*   **Calculated Osmolality:** Estimated from the concentrations of major solutes in the plasma
*   **Osmolal Gap:** The difference between measured osmolality and calculated osmolality. An elevated osmolal gap suggests the presence of unmeasured osmotically active substances in the plasma

### **Calculation of Osmolality** {-}

*   **Formula**
    *   $Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2[Na^+] + \left( \frac {[Glucose (mg/dL)]} {18} \right) + \left( \frac {[BUN (mg/dL)]} {2.8} \right)$
    *   Where:
        *   [$Na^+$] = Sodium concentration in mmol/L
        *   [$Glucose$] = Glucose concentration in mg/dL
        *   [$BUN$] = Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL
        *   18 = Conversion factor for glucose (mg/dL to mmol/L)
        *   2.8 = Conversion factor for BUN (mg/dL to mmol/L)
*   **SI Units**
    *   $Osmolality (mmol/kg) = 2[Na^+] + [Glucose] + [Urea]$
    *   Where:
        *   [$Na^+$] = Sodium concentration in mmol/L
        *   [$Glucose$] = Glucose concentration in mmol/L
        *   [$Urea$] = Urea concentration in mmol/L
*   **Normal Range**
    *   275-295 mOsm/kg
    *   Most contributions to the measured serum osmolality comes from sodium, chloride, potassium, urea, and glucose

### **Clinical Significance of Osmolality** {-}

*   **Assessment of Hydration Status:** Osmolality reflects the balance between water and solutes in the blood
*   **Evaluation of Kidney Function:** Osmolality can be used to assess the kidney's ability to concentrate or dilute urine
*   **Diagnosis of Electrolyte Imbalances:** Changes in osmolality can indicate electrolyte disorders
*   **Detection of Toxic Substances:** An elevated osmolal gap can suggest the presence of unmeasured osmotically active substances (e.g., ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol)

### **Increased Osmolality** {-}

*   **Causes**
    *   Dehydration: Water deficit leads to increased solute concentration
    *   Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels
    *   Hyperglycemia: Elevated glucose levels (e.g., in diabetes)
    *   Uremia: Elevated BUN levels (e.g., in kidney failure)
    *   Toxic Ingestions: Presence of unmeasured osmotically active substances (e.g., ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol)
*   **Symptoms**
    *   Thirst, confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma

### **Decreased Osmolality** {-}

*   **Causes**
    *   Overhydration: Water excess leads to decreased solute concentration
    *   Hyponatremia: Low sodium levels
    *   SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion): Excessive ADH leads to water retention
    *   Adrenal Insufficiency: Impaired cortisol production affects water and electrolyte balance
*   **Symptoms**
    *   Nausea, headache, confusion, muscle cramps, seizures, coma

### **Increased Osmolal Gap** {-}

*   **Causes**
    *   Presence of unmeasured osmotically active substances:
        *   Ethanol
        *   Methanol
        *   Ethylene Glycol
        *   Isopropanol
        *   Propylene Glycol
        *   Acetone
    *   Less Common Causes:
        *   Mannitol
        *   Glycerol
        *   Severe Hyperlipidemia or Hyperproteinemia
        *   Lactic Acidosis

## **Anion Gap** {-}

*   **Definition:** The difference between measured cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions) in serum or plasma. It is used to assess acid-base balance, particularly in cases of metabolic acidosis
*   **Purpose:** The anion gap helps identify the cause of metabolic acidosis by distinguishing between conditions that increase unmeasured anions and those that result in a loss of bicarbonate
*   **Measured Ions**
    *   Cations: Sodium ($Na^+$) and Potassium ($K^+$)
    *   Anions: Chloride ($Cl^-$) and Bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$)

### **Calculation of Anion Gap** {-}

*   **Formula**
    *   Anion Gap = ($Na^+$ + $K^+$) - ($Cl^-$ + $HCO_3^-$)
    *   Anion Gap = $Na^+$ - ($Cl^-$ + $HCO_3^-$) (when potassium is not measured)
*   **Normal Range**
    *   With Potassium: 8-16 mEq/L or mmol/L
    *   Without Potassium: 10-20 mEq/L or mmol/L

### **Clinical Significance of Anion Gap** {-}

*   **Normal Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (NAGMA)**
    *   Also known as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
    *   The decrease in bicarbonate is compensated by an increase in chloride, maintaining a normal anion gap
    *   Causes:
        *   Gastrointestinal Bicarbonate Loss: Diarrhea, ileostomy
        *   Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA): Impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate or impaired excretion of acid by the kidneys
        *   Administration of Chloride-Containing Solutions: Saline infusion
        *   Certain Medications: Acetazolamide, cholestyramine
*   **Elevated Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA)**
    *   The decrease in bicarbonate is accompanied by an increase in unmeasured anions, resulting in an elevated anion gap
    *   Causes:
        *   Ketoacidosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketoacidosis, starvation ketoacidosis
        *   Lactic Acidosis: Anaerobic metabolism due to shock, sepsis, or severe exercise
        *   Renal Failure: Accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, and other organic acids
        *   Toxic Ingestions:
            *   Methanol: Metabolized to formic acid
            *   Ethylene Glycol: Metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid
            *   Salicylates: Disrupts cellular metabolism
    *   Mnemonic for High Anion Gap Acidosis: "MUDPILES"
        *   M: Methanol
        *   U: Uremia (Renal Failure)
        *   D: Diabetic Ketoacidosis
        *   P: Propylene Glycol
        *   I: Iron, Isoniazid
        *   L: Lactic Acidosis
        *   E: Ethylene Glycol
        *   S: Salicylates
*   **Decreased Anion Gap**
    *   Rare and typically less clinically significant
    *   Causes:
        *   Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin is a major unmeasured anion, so decreased albumin levels can lower the anion gap
        *   Multiple Myeloma: Increased levels of cationic immunoglobulins
        *   Bromide Intoxication: Bromide is measured as chloride, leading to an artificially elevated chloride level and a decreased anion gap
        *   Lithium Toxicity: Causes $Cl^-$ retention
