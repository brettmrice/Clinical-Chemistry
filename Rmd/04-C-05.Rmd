# Disease Correlation {-}

Understanding the connections between specific disease states and alterations in drug pharmacokinetics is essential for effective therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Different diseases can significantly impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), thereby influencing drug concentrations and therapeutic outcomes

## **General Principles of Disease State Correlation in TDM** {-}
