# Physiology {-}

Understanding the normal and abnormal states associated with vitamin and nutrient metabolism is crucial for identifying and managing nutritional disorders

## **General Principles of Nutritional Status** {-}

*   **Nutritional Requirements**
    *   The body requires a balanced intake of macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) for optimal health
    *   Nutritional requirements vary based on age, sex, activity level, and physiological state (e.g., pregnancy, lactation)
*   **Dietary Intake and Absorption**
    *   Adequate dietary intake is essential for meeting nutritional requirements
    *   Factors affecting absorption: Digestive function, intestinal health, and interactions with other nutrients and medications
*   **Metabolic Processes**
    *   Nutrients undergo various metabolic processes (digestion, absorption, transport, storage, and utilization)
    *   Enzymes, hormones, and other factors regulate these processes
*   **Assessment of Nutritional Status**
    *   **Dietary Assessment:** Evaluation of dietary intake and eating habits
    *   **Anthropometric Measurements:** Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and body composition
    *   **Biochemical Tests:** Measurement of nutrient levels and related metabolites in blood, urine, and tissues
    *   **Clinical Assessment:** Physical examination to identify signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies or excesses

## **Normal Nutritional States** {-}

*   **Adequate Dietary Intake**
    *   Consumption of a balanced diet that meets the body's nutritional requirements
    *   Includes a variety of foods from different food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, protein sources, and dairy)
*   **Normal Absorption and Utilization**
    *   Efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract
    *   Normal metabolic processes for nutrient utilization in cells and tissues
*   **Optimal Nutrient Levels**
    *   Maintenance of nutrient levels within the normal reference ranges
    *   Adequate storage and mobilization of nutrients as needed

## **Abnormal Nutritional States** {-}
