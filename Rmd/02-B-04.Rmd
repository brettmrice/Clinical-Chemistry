# Disease Correlation {-}

Accurate lab testing, and the ability to correlate the results to a patient's symptoms, greatly assists in accurate diagnosis and treatment

## **Liver Diseases**

*   **Cirrhosis**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Chemistry
            *   Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin): Decreased liver synthesis
            *   Elevated Total Bilirubin: Impaired bilirubin metabolism and excretion
            *   Elevated Liver Enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT): Variable, may be normal or decreased in advanced stages
        *   Hematology
            *   Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT): Decreased synthesis of clotting factors
    *   Disease State Correlation: Chronic liver damage leads to impaired protein synthesis, bilirubin metabolism, and clotting factor production
    *   Clinical Significance: Reflects the severity of liver dysfunction
*   **Hepatitis (Viral, Alcoholic, Drug-Induced)**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Elevated Liver Enzymes (ALT and AST): Indicators of liver inflammation and damage
        *   Elevated Total Bilirubin: Impaired bilirubin metabolism
        *   Elevated Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin: Indicates cholestasis (impaired bile flow)
    *   Disease State Correlation: Liver inflammation causes cell damage, leading to elevated liver enzymes and impaired bilirubin metabolism
    *   Clinical Significance: Provides insights into the extent of liver damage
    *   Specific causes such as alcoholic hepatitis will show elevated GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase)
*   **Hepatic Encephalopathy**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Elevated Ammonia: Impaired urea cycle function
    *   Disease State Correlation: Liver failure leads to impaired ammonia detoxification, resulting in neurological dysfunction
    *   Clinical Significance: Requires quick treatment to help prevent permanent brain damage

## **Kidney Diseases**

*   **Nephrotic Syndrome**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Proteinuria: Excretion of > 3.5 g of protein per day in urine
        *   Hypoalbuminemia: Decreased protein intake
    *   Disease State Correlation: Damage to the glomeruli leads to increased protein loss in urine, decreased serum albumin, and edema
    *   Clinical Significance: Indicates glomerular damage
*   **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Elevated Serum Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): Decreased renal excretion
        *   Proteinuria: Kidney damage leads to increased protein excretion
    *   Disease State Correlation: Gradual loss of kidney function leads to decreased excretion of waste products and increased protein excretion
    *   Clinical Significance: Indicates impaired kidney function

## **Nutritional Disorders**

*   **Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM)**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Hypoalbuminemia: Due to decreased protein synthesis
        *   Low Prealbumin (Transthyretin): Indicates recent protein loss
    *   Disease State Correlation: Inadequate intake of protein and energy leads to depletion of body protein stores and impaired organ function
    *   Clinical Significance: Used to measure nutritional deficiency

## **Cancer**

*   **Multiple Myeloma**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Monoclonal Gammopathy: A single, abnormally elevated immunoglobulin peak on serum protein electrophoresis
        *   Bence Jones Protein: Monoclonal light chains in urine
    *   Disease State Correlation: A proliferation of plasma cells produces large amounts of a single immunoglobulin or light chain, which can be detected in serum and urine
    *   Clinical Significance: Helpful in diagnosing cancer
*   **Tumor Markers (Prostate Cancer, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Ovarian Cancer)**
    *   Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) - Prostate Cancer
    *   Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) - Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Germ Cell Tumors
    *   Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) - Ovarian Cancer
    *   Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) - Colorectal, Lung Cancer
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated levels of the specific tumor marker
    *   Disease State Correlation: Tumor cells produce specific tumor markers that can be detected in the blood
    *   Clinical Significance: Monitoring, assessing, and helping determine the stage of the cancer

## **Other Conditions**

*   **Gout**
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Hyperuricemia (Elevated Serum Uric Acid)
    *   Disease State Correlation: Increased uric acid production or decreased excretion leads to urate crystal deposition in joints
    *   Clinical Significance: Confirmation of gout is possible through detection of uric acid crystals within synovial fluid of joints

## **Key Terms**
