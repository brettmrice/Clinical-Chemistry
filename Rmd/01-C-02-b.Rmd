    *   Special Precautions: Protect from light, analyze as soon as possible
*   **Iron Studies**
    *   Specimen Type: Serum (fasting sample preferred)
    *   Tube Type: Trace metal-free tube

*   **Urine Bilirubin**
    *   Handling: Protect from light
    *   Processing: Analyze the sample immediately. If a delay is unavoidable, refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 2 hours
*   **Urine Urobilinogen**
    *   Handling: Protect from light
    *   Processing: Analyze the sample immediately. If a delay is unavoidable, refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 4 hours
*   **Iron Studies**
    *   Handling: Avoid hemolysis
    *   Processing: Centrifuge the sample promptly. Analyze immediately or store refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or -70°C
*   **Porphyrin Analysis**
    *   Handling: Protect from light
    *   Processing: Follow specific extraction and purification procedures for each type of sample (urine, blood, feces). Store samples frozen at -20°C or -70°C until analysis
*   **Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)**
    *   Handling: Follow specific instructions for developing the test
    *   Processing: Develop the test within the recommended time frame. Store developed tests properly to maintain color stability

## **Analytical Considerations** {-}

*   **Reagent Quality**
    *   Bilirubin: Use fresh reagents, as diazo reagents can degrade over time. Store reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Iron Studies: Use high-quality reagents to minimize interferences from trace metals
    *   Porphyrin Analysis: Use high-purity solvents and standards for chromatography
    *   FOBT: Ensure the guaiac paper is not expired and is properly stored
*   **Calibration**
    *   Bilirubin: Calibrate spectrophotometers regularly using bilirubin standards
    *   Iron Studies: Calibrate instruments using iron standards
    *   Porphyrin Analysis: Calibrate HPLC instruments using porphyrin standards
*   **Quality Control (QC)**
    *   Bilirubin: Run quality control samples at regular intervals to monitor the accuracy and precision of bilirubin assays
    *   Iron Studies: Run quality control samples for serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation, and ferritin assays
    *   Porphyrin Analysis: Run quality control samples to monitor the performance of chromatographic separations and detection
    *   FOBT: Use positive and negative controls to ensure the test is working properly

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Bilirubin**
    *   Lipemia: Causes turbidity, affecting spectrophotometric readings
        *   Mitigation: Use lipemia clearing techniques (ultracentrifugation, lipid clearing reagents) or methods less affected by turbidity
    *   Hemolysis: Interferes with diazo reaction
        *   Mitigation: Avoid hemolysis during collection and processing
