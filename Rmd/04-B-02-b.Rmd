# Precautions {-}

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of vitamin and nutrient analyses requires meticulous attention to pre-analytical factors, proper specimen handling, and awareness of potential interferences

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   **Fasting:** Some nutrient tests require patients to fast for a specified period (e.g., 8-12 hours) before specimen collection
        *   **Rationale:** Fasting minimizes the effects of recent food intake on nutrient levels
        *   **Examples:** Lipid profiles, glucose, iron studies
    *   **Medications:** Certain medications can interfere with nutrient tests
        *   **Rationale:** Medications can affect nutrient absorption, metabolism, or excretion
        *   **Examples**
            *   Oral contraceptives: Affect vitamin B6 and folate levels
            *   Metformin: Affect vitamin B12 levels
            *   Cholestyramine: Affect fat-soluble vitamin absorption
        *   **Action:** Inquire about medications and supplements the patient is taking
    *   **Supplements:** Inform patients to avoid taking vitamin and mineral supplements for a specified period before testing
        *   **Rationale:** Supplements can falsely elevate nutrient levels
        *   **Action:** Follow the laboratory's guidelines for supplement restrictions
    *   **Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol can affect nutrient absorption and metabolism
        *   **Rationale:** Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to deficiencies in thiamin, folate, and other nutrients
        *   **Action:** Instruct patients to avoid alcohol consumption for 24-48 hours before testing
    *   **Timing:** For some nutrients, the timing of specimen collection can be important due to diurnal variations or postprandial changes
        *   **Rationale:** Iron levels vary throughout the day; lipid profiles are affected by recent food intake
        *   **Action:** Collect specimens at the specified time

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Collection Tubes**
    *   Use appropriate collection tubes for each nutrient test
        *   **Rationale:** Different tubes contain different anticoagulants and additives that can affect nutrient stability and assay performance
        *   **Examples**
            *   EDTA tubes: Commonly used for vitamin B12, folate, and iron studies
            *   Serum separator tubes (SST): Used for fat-soluble vitamins
            *   Light-protected tubes: Used for light-sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin B6)
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for tube selection
*   **Order of Draw**
    *   Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents cross-contamination from tube additives
        *   **Action:** Consult the CLSI guidelines for the correct order of draw
*   **Technique**
    *   Use proper venipuncture technique
        *   **Rationale:** Minimizes hemolysis and contamination
        *   **Action:** Avoid prolonged tourniquet time and use a gentle technique
*   **Labeling**
    *   Label specimens immediately and accurately
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents misidentification and errors
        *   **Action:** Use two patient identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth)
*   **Volume**
    *   Collect the correct volume of blood
        *   **Rationale:** Insufficient volume can affect assay performance
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for minimum volume requirements

## **Specimen Processing** {-}

*   **Centrifugation**
    *   Centrifuge specimens promptly after collection
        *   **Rationale:** Separates serum or plasma from cells
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for centrifugation speed and time
*   **Separation**
    *   Separate serum or plasma from cells within the specified time frame
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents hemolysis and degradation of nutrients
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for separation time
*   **Aliquotting**
    *   Aliquot specimens into appropriate containers
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents contamination and allows for multiple tests
        *   **Action:** Use clean, dry containers
*   **Storage**
    *   Store specimens at the appropriate temperature
        *   **Rationale:** Preserves nutrient stability
        *   **Examples**
            *   Refrigeration (2-8°C): For short-term storage
            *   Freezing (-20°C or -80°C): For long-term storage
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage conditions
*   **Thawing**
    *   Thaw specimens properly before testing
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents degradation of nutrients
        *   **Action:** Thaw at room temperature or in a refrigerator, and mix gently
*   **Light Protection**
    *   Protect light-sensitive vitamins from light exposure during collection, processing, and storage
        *   **Rationale:** Light can degrade certain vitamins (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin B6, folate)
        *   **Action:** Use amber-colored tubes or wrap clear tubes in aluminum foil

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Hemolysis**
    *   **Interference:** Releases intracellular components that can interfere with nutrient assays
    *   **Mechanism:** Interferes with spectrophotometric or immunoassay measurements
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid hemolysis during collection and processing
*   **Lipemia**
    *   **Interference:** Turbidity from high lipid concentrations can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   **Mechanism:** Lipids scatter light, leading to inaccurate absorbance measurements
    *   **Mitigation:** Use lipemia clearing techniques or consider methods less affected by turbidity
*   **Bilirubin**
    *   **Interference:** High bilirubin levels can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   **Mechanism:** Bilirubin absorbs light at similar wavelengths, affecting absorbance readings
    *   **Mitigation:** Use methods less susceptible to bilirubin interference or employ bilirubin correction techniques
*   **Drugs**
    *   **Interference:** Certain drugs can directly affect nutrient levels or interfere with nutrient assays
    *   **Examples**
        *   Metformin: Affects vitamin B12 levels
        *   Cholestyramine: Affects fat-soluble vitamin absorption
        *   Oral contraceptives: Affect vitamin B6 and folate levels
    *   **Mitigation:** Be aware of patient's medication list
*   **Heterophile Antibodies**
    *   **Interference:** Bind to assay antibodies, causing falsely high or low results
    *   **Mechanism:** Non-specific binding to assay components
    *   **Mitigation:** Use blocking reagents or heterophile antibody blocking tubes
*   **Cross-Reactivity**
    *   **Interference:** Assay antibodies may cross-react with structurally similar compounds, leading to inaccurate results
    *   **Mechanism:** Antibodies bind to unintended targets
    *   **Mitigation:** Use highly specific antibodies and be aware of potential cross-reactants
*   **Biotin**
    *   **Interference:** High levels of biotin can interfere with biotin-streptavidin assays, causing falsely high or low results
    *   **Mechanism:** Biotin competes with the analyte for binding to streptavidin
    *   **Mitigation:** Ask patients to discontinue biotin supplements for several days before testing
*   **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**
    *   **Interference:** Can interfere with certain assays by acting as a reducing agent
    *   **Mitigation:** Use methods less susceptible to ascorbic acid interference
*   **Homocysteine**
    *   **Interference:** Elevated homocysteine levels can interfere with folate and vitamin B12 assays
    *   **Mitigation:** Consider measuring homocysteine levels separately
