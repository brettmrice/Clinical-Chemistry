# Result Interpretation {-}

Interpreting heme derivative test results requires integrating lab values with the patient's clinical presentation and medical history. Deviations from reference intervals can indicate various conditions

*   **Key Tests**
    *   Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect)
    *   Urine Bilirubin
    *   Urine Urobilinogen
    *   Iron Studies (Serum Iron, TIBC, Transferrin Saturation, Ferritin)
    *   Porphyrin Analysis (Urine, Blood, Feces)

## **Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Total Bilirubin**
    *   Reference Interval: 0.3-1.0 mg/dL (5.1-17.1 μmol/L)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Elevated levels indicate hyperbilirubinemia
*   **Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin**
    *   Reference Interval: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL (0-5.1 μmol/L)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Elevated levels suggest biliary obstruction or liver disease
*   **Indirect (Unconjugated) Bilirubin**
    *   Reference Interval: 0.2-0.8 mg/dL (3.4-13.7 μmol/L)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Elevated levels suggest increased red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis) or impaired liver uptake/conjugation
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Elevated total bilirubin with increased indirect bilirubin suggests pre-hepatic (hemolytic) jaundice
    *   Elevated total bilirubin with increased direct bilirubin suggests hepatic or post-hepatic (obstructive) jaundice
    *   Isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin can be seen in Gilbert's syndrome

## **Urine Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** Negative
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Positive result indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Suggests biliary obstruction or liver disease (conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted in urine)
    *   Absent in pre-hepatic jaundice (unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble)

## **Urine Urobilinogen** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** 0.2-1.0 mg/dL (3.4-16.9 μmol/L)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Increased levels suggest increased red blood cell breakdown or liver disease
    *   Decreased or absent levels suggest biliary obstruction
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Elevated in hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, and early stages of biliary obstruction
    *   Decreased or absent in complete biliary obstruction (e.g., gallstones, tumors)

## **Iron Studies** {-}

*   **Serum Iron**
    *   Reference Interval: 60-170 μg/dL (10.7-30.4 μmol/L)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Decreased levels suggest iron deficiency
        *   Elevated levels suggest iron overload
*   **Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)**
    *   Reference Interval: 240-450 μg/dL (42.9-80.6 μmol/L)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Elevated levels suggest iron deficiency
        *   Decreased levels suggest iron overload or chronic inflammation
*   **Transferrin Saturation**
    *   Reference Interval: 20-50%
    *   Interpretation
        *   Decreased levels suggest iron deficiency
        *   Elevated levels suggest iron overload
*   **Ferritin**
    *   Reference Interval: 20-200 ng/mL (women), 20-500 ng/mL (men)
    *   Interpretation
        *   Decreased levels are a sensitive indicator of iron deficiency
        *   Elevated levels suggest iron overload, inflammation, or malignancy
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Iron deficiency anemia: Decreased serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation; increased TIBC
    *   Iron overload (Hemochromatosis): Increased serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation; decreased TIBC
    *   Anemia of chronic disease: Decreased serum iron and TIBC; normal or increased ferritin

## **Porphyrin Analysis** {-}

*   **Interpretation**
    *   Elevated levels of specific porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in urine, blood, or feces indicate porphyria
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Different types of porphyria are associated with specific enzyme deficiencies and accumulation of specific porphyrins
    *   Accurate identification of the specific porphyrins is essential for diagnosis and management

## **Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)** {-}

*   **Interpretation**
    *   Positive result indicates the presence of blood in the stool
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be due to:
        *   Colorectal cancer
        *   Polyps
        *   Ulcers
        *   Inflammatory bowel disease
        *   Other gastrointestinal conditions
    *   Positive FOBT requires further investigation with colonoscopy or other diagnostic procedures

## **Factors Affecting Interpretation** {-}

*   **Medications:** Certain medications can affect bilirubin and iron levels (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, oral contraceptives, iron supplements)
*   **Hemolysis:** Can falsely elevate serum iron levels and affect bilirubin assays
*   **Diet:** Iron-rich foods can affect serum iron levels
*   **Liver and Kidney Function:** Can affect bilirubin metabolism and excretion
*   **Genetic Factors:** Can influence iron absorption and storage
*   **Age and Gender:** Reference intervals may vary with age and gender
