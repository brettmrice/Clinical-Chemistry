# Alcohols {-}

Understanding the chemical and physical properties of alcohols is crucial in toxicology

## **General Properties of Alcohols** {-}

*   **Definition:** Organic compounds characterized by the presence of one or more hydroxyl ($-OH$) groups attached to a carbon atom
*   **Nomenclature:** Named by adding the suffix "-ol" to the parent alkane name (e.g., methanol, ethanol)
*   **Classification:** Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary, depending on the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group
*   **Hydrogen Bonding:** The presence of the hydroxyl group allows alcohols to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, including water

## **Chemical Properties of Alcohols** {-}

*   **Polarity:** The hydroxyl group makes alcohols polar molecules
*   **Acidity:** Alcohols are weakly acidic due to the ability of the hydroxyl group to donate a proton ($H^+$)
*   **Reactivity:** Alcohols undergo various chemical reactions, including:
    *   Oxidation: Alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, depending on the alcohol and the oxidizing agent
    *   Esterification: Alcohols react with carboxylic acids to form esters
    *   Dehydration: Alcohols can be dehydrated to form alkenes
    *   Ether Formation: Alcohols react with other alcohols to form ethers
*    **Flammability:** Alcohols are flammable

## **Physical Properties of Alcohols** {-}

*   **Appearance:** Alcohols can be liquids or solids at room temperature, depending on their molecular weight
*   **Boiling Point:** Boiling points increase with increasing molecular weight and hydrogen bonding
*   **Solubility:** Alcohols with short carbon chains are miscible with water due to hydrogen bonding. Solubility decreases as the carbon chain length increases, because the influence of the nonpolar part of the molecule increases
*   **Viscosity:** Alcohols tend to be more viscous than alkanes with similar molecular weights due to hydrogen bonding
