# Drugs of Abuse {-}

Studying drugs of abuse in toxicology calls for understanding their core properties. In this section, we look at the properties of drugs of abuse

## **General Properties of Drugs of Abuse** {-}

*   **Definition:** Drugs of abuse are substances that are used for non-medical purposes, often for their psychoactive effects, and can lead to dependence, addiction, and adverse health consequences
*   **Classification:** Drugs of abuse can be classified into several categories based on their pharmacological effects:
    *   Opioids: Produce analgesia, euphoria, and sedation (e.g., heroin, morphine, oxycodone)
    *   Stimulants: Increase alertness, energy, and euphoria (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine)
    *   Cannabinoids: Produce relaxation, altered perception, and euphoria (e.g., marijuana, hashish)
    *   Hallucinogens: Alter perception, thought, and mood (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, MDMA)
    *   Depressants: Slow down brain activity, producing relaxation and sedation (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)
    *   Inhalants: Volatile substances that produce psychoactive effects when inhaled (e.g., solvents, aerosols, gases)
*   **Common Properties**
    *   Psychoactive Effects: Alter mood, perception, and cognition
    *   Reinforcing Effects: Produce pleasurable or rewarding experiences that promote continued use
    *   Addictive Potential: Can lead to dependence and addiction

## **Chemical Properties of Drugs of Abuse** {-}

*   **Structural Diversity:** Drugs of abuse exhibit significant structural diversity, encompassing a wide range of chemical classes
*   **Functional Groups:** They contain various functional groups, such as hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, ester, and ether groups, which influence their solubility, binding properties, and metabolism
*   **Basic or Acidic Character:** Many drugs of abuse are weak bases or acids
*   **Chirality:** Some drugs of abuse are chiral molecules, existing as enantiomers or diastereomers with differing pharmacological activities
*   **Chemical Stability:** Varies widely depending on the specific drug and its formulation; storage conditions can affect stability

## **Physical Properties of Drugs of Abuse** {-}

*   **Appearance:** Crystalline solids, powders, liquids, or plant materials
*   **Solubility:** Varies depending on the specific drug and its chemical structure
*   **Partition Coefficient (Log P):** Indicates the relative affinity of a drug for lipid and aqueous phases
*   **Ionization:** Acidic or basic properties influence their absorption, distribution, and excretion
*   **Protein Binding:** Binding to plasma proteins (albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein)
*   **Melting Point:** Characteristic property for identification and purity assessment
*   **Boiling Point:** Important for volatile substances
*   **Hygroscopicity:** Some drugs of abuse are hygroscopic, absorbing moisture from the air

## **Specific Drugs of Abuse** {-}

### **Opioids (e.g., Morphine)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Opioids are a class of drugs that bind to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, producing analgesia, euphoria, and sedation
*   **Examples:** Morphine, codeine, heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl
*   **Chemical Structure:** Complex alkaloids with a characteristic morphinan ring structure
*   **Molecular Weight:** Varies depending on the specific opioid (e.g., morphine: 285.34 g/mol)
*   **Solubility:** Varies depending on the specific opioid, but generally soluble in water or alcohol
*   **Ionization:** Weak bases
*   **Protein Binding:** Varies depending on the specific opioid
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Rapid absorption after oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration; extensive metabolism in the liver; renal excretion

### **Stimulants (e.g., Cocaine)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Stimulants are a class of drugs that increase alertness, energy, and euphoria by affecting the central nervous system
*   **Examples:** Cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate
*   **Chemical Structure:** Amphetamines are derivatives of phenethylamine; cocaine is a benzoylmethylecgonine
*   **Molecular Weight:** Varies depending on the specific stimulant (e.g., cocaine: 303.36 g/mol)
*   **Solubility:** Varies depending on the specific stimulant, but generally soluble in water or alcohol
*   **Ionization:** Weak bases
*   **Protein Binding:** Varies depending on the specific stimulant
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Rapid absorption after various routes of administration (oral, intranasal, intravenous, smoking); metabolized in the liver; excreted in the urine

### **Cannabinoids (e.g., THC)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Cannabinoids are a class of chemical compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors in cells that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain
*   **Examples:** Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN)
*   **Chemical Structure:** Tricyclic compounds with a characteristic dibenzopyran ring system
*   **Molecular Weight:** Varies depending on the specific cannabinoid (e.g., THC: 314.46 g/mol)
*   **Solubility:** Highly lipophilic and poorly soluble in water
*   **Ionization:** Neutral
*   **Protein Binding:** Highly protein-bound
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Rapid absorption when smoked or vaporized; slow and variable absorption after oral administration; extensive metabolism in the liver; excreted in the feces and urine

### **Hallucinogens (e.g., LSD)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that alter perception, thought, and mood
*   **Examples:** Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)
*   **Chemical Structure:** Highly variable, depending on the specific hallucinogen
*   **Molecular Weight:** Varies depending on the specific hallucinogen (e.g., LSD: 328.43 g/mol)
*   **Solubility:** Varies depending on the specific hallucinogen
*   **Ionization:** Some are basic, some are neutral
*   **Protein Binding:** Varies depending on the specific hallucinogen
