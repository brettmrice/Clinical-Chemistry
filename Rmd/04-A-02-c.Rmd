# Stimulation/Suppression {-}

Dynamic endocrine testing, through stimulation or suppression, helps assess gland function by challenging the normal feedback loops and observing the hormonal response

## **Principles of Stimulation/Suppression Testing** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the functional reserve of an endocrine gland or to assess the autonomy of hormone production
*   **Dynamic Assessment:** Unlike static hormone measurements, these tests measure the gland's response to a challenge
*   **Types of Tests**
    *   **Stimulation Tests:** Used to assess hormone deficiency by stimulating hormone release and measuring the gland's capacity to respond
    *   **Suppression Tests:** Used to assess hormone excess by suppressing hormone production and measuring the gland's ability to be inhibited
*   **General Procedure**
    1.  **Baseline Sample Collection:** One or more baseline blood samples are collected to measure initial hormone levels
    2.  **Administration of Stimulatory or Suppressive Agent:** A specific agent is administered to stimulate or suppress hormone production
    3.  **Serial Sample Collection:** Blood samples are collected at specified intervals after the agent is administered to monitor the hormone response
    4.  **Interpretation:** Hormone levels are measured and compared to established reference ranges to determine if the endocrine gland is functioning normally

## **Common Stimulation Tests** {-}

### **ACTH Stimulation Test (Cosyntropin Test)** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To assess adrenal gland function and diagnose adrenal insufficiency
*   **Principle:** Synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) is administered to stimulate cortisol production by the adrenal glands
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Baseline cortisol level is measured
    2.  Cosyntropin (250 μg) is administered intravenously or intramuscularly
    3.  Cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes post-injection
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Normal Response:** Cortisol level increases by at least 20 μg/dL from baseline and reaches a peak value of at least 20 μg/dL
    *   **Primary Adrenal Insufficiency:** Minimal or no increase in cortisol levels, indicating adrenal gland dysfunction
    *   **Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency:** Delayed or subnormal response, indicating pituitary dysfunction
*   **Special Considerations**
    *   Patient should be off any glucocorticoid medications prior to the test
    *   False-positive results can occur in patients with acute illness or stress

### **Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To assess growth hormone (GH) and ACTH reserve
*   **Principle:** Insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates the release of GH and ACTH
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Baseline GH and cortisol levels are measured
    2.  Regular insulin (0.05-0.15 U/kg) is administered intravenously to induce hypoglycemia
    3.  GH and cortisol levels are measured at 30, 60, and 90 minutes post-injection
    4.  Blood glucose levels are monitored throughout the test to ensure adequate hypoglycemia (glucose < 40 mg/dL)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Normal GH Response:** GH level increases to at least 5-10 ng/mL
    *   **Normal Cortisol Response:** Cortisol level increases by at least 7 μg/dL from baseline and reaches a peak value of at least 20 μg/dL
    *   **Abnormal Response:** Failure to achieve adequate hypoglycemia or failure of GH and/or cortisol to increase appropriately
*   **Special Considerations**
    *   ITT is contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease, seizures, or known adrenal insufficiency
    *   Test should be performed under close medical supervision due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia

### **TRH Stimulation Test** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To assess pituitary TSH reserve and diagnose thyroid disorders
*   **Principle:** TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) stimulates the release of TSH from the pituitary gland
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Baseline TSH level is measured
    2.  TRH (200-500 μg) is administered intravenously
    3.  TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60 minutes post-injection
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Normal Response:** TSH level increases by at least 5 μIU/mL from baseline
    *   **Primary Hypothyroidism:** Elevated baseline TSH with an exaggerated response to TRH
    *   **Secondary Hypothyroidism:** Low or normal baseline TSH with a blunted or absent response to TRH, indicating pituitary dysfunction
    *   **Tertiary Hypothyroidism:** Low or normal baseline TSH with a delayed response to TRH, indicating hypothalamic dysfunction
*   **Special Considerations**
    *   Patient should be off any thyroid hormone medications prior to the test
    *   Certain medications (e.g., glucocorticoids, dopamine) can affect TSH secretion and interfere with the test results

## **Common Suppression Tests** {-}

### **Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST)** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To diagnose Cushing's syndrome and differentiate its causes
*   **Principle:** Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses ACTH production by the pituitary gland, which in turn suppresses cortisol production by the adrenal glands
*   **Types of DST**
    *   **Low-Dose DST:** Used to screen for Cushing's syndrome
    *   **High-Dose DST:** Used to differentiate between pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Low-Dose DST**
        1.  Baseline cortisol level is measured
        2.  Dexamethasone (1 mg) is administered orally at 11 PM
        3.  Cortisol level is measured at 8 AM the following morning
    *   **High-Dose DST**
        1.  Baseline cortisol and ACTH levels are measured
        2.  Dexamethasone (8 mg) is administered orally at 11 PM
        3.  Cortisol and ACTH levels are measured at 8 AM the following morning
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Low-Dose DST**
        *   **Normal Suppression:** Cortisol level is suppressed to < 1.8 μg/dL
        *   **Lack of Suppression:** Cortisol level remains elevated, indicating Cushing's syndrome
    *   **High-Dose DST**
        *   **Pituitary-Dependent Cushing's Disease:** Cortisol level is suppressed by at least 50% from baseline
        *   **Ectopic ACTH-Secreting Tumor:** Cortisol level is not suppressed
        *   **Adrenal Tumor:** Cortisol level is not suppressed
*   **Special Considerations**
    *   Certain medications (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) can increase the metabolism of dexamethasone and interfere with the test results
    *   False-positive results can occur in patients with depression, alcoholism, or chronic stress

### **Oral Glucose Suppression Test** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To diagnose acromegaly
*   **Principle:** Glucose normally suppresses growth hormone (GH) secretion
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Baseline GH level is measured
    2.  Patient drinks a standard glucose solution (75 g)
    3.  GH levels are measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-ingestion
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Normal Suppression:** GH level is suppressed to < 1 ng/mL
    *   **Lack of Suppression:** GH level remains elevated, indicating autonomous GH secretion characteristic of acromegaly
*   **Special Considerations**
    *   Certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers) can interfere with the test results
    *   False-positive results can occur in patients with renal failure or liver disease

## **General Precautions and Considerations** {-}

*   **Patient Selection:** Ensure that the patient is an appropriate candidate for the test and that there are no contraindications
*   **Medication Review:** Review the patient's medication list and determine if any medications need to be withheld prior to the test
*   **Informed Consent:** Obtain informed consent from the patient after explaining the purpose, procedure, and potential risks of the test
*   **Adverse Reactions:** Be prepared to manage potential adverse reactions to the stimulatory or suppressive agent
*   **Standardized Procedures:** Follow standardized procedures for test administration, sample collection, and hormone measurement
*   **Quality Control:** Implement rigorous quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of hormone measurements
*   **Reference Ranges:** Use appropriate reference ranges for the specific test and patient population
*   **Clinical Correlation:** Interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory findings
