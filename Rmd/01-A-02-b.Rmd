# Special Precautions {-}

Accurate carbohydrate testing hinges on proper technique. It starts from the moment of specimen collection and continues through to troubleshooting any issues that might pop up

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   **Fasting:** For accurate glucose and lipid measurements, patients typically need to fast for 8-12 hours before specimen collection. This ensures that postprandial effects don't skew the results
    *   **Medications:** Some drugs can influence carbohydrate metabolism. It's important to know if the patient is taking corticosteroids, diuretics, or other meds that could impact glucose levels
    *   **Infection/Stress:** Illness and stress can elevate glucose. If the patient is acutely ill, note this on the request form, as it can influence interpretation

*   **Specimen Collection**
    *   **Timing:** Strict adherence to collection times is essential, especially for glucose tolerance tests. Meticulously document the time each sample is drawn
    *   **Order of Draw:** Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes. This minimizes the risk of cross-contamination from tube additives
    *   **Anticoagulants:** Use the right anticoagulant for the test. For glucose, fluoride oxalate tubes are often used because they inhibit glycolysis

*   **Specimen Handling**
    *   **Prompt Processing:** Glucose levels can change quickly in unseparated samples as cells continue to metabolize glucose. Process the sample as soon as possible
    *   **Temperature Control:** Keep samples refrigerated (2-8Â°C) if testing is delayed, but avoid freezing whole blood

*   **Reagent Handling**
    *   **Storage:** Store reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incorrect storage can degrade reagents, leading to inaccurate results
    *   **Expiration Dates:** Always check expiration dates and discard expired reagents
    *   **Contamination:** Prevent contamination of reagents. Use clean technique when handling, and avoid introducing bacteria or other substances that could interfere

*   **Instrumentation**
    *   **Calibration:** Regularly calibrate instruments using appropriate standards. This ensures that readings are accurate and consistent over time
    *   **Maintenance:** Follow the instrument's maintenance schedule. Routine maintenance can prevent breakdowns and maintain performance
    *   **Quality Control:** Run quality control samples at regular intervals to monitor the accuracy and precision of the instrument

## **Specimen Collection and Processing** {-}

*   **Glucose**
    *   **Specimen:** Plasma (fluoride oxalate tube), serum
    *   **Collection:** Fasting sample preferred. Collect in appropriate tube, invert gently to mix with anticoagulant
    *   **Processing:** Centrifuge promptly (within 30 minutes of collection) to separate plasma or serum. Analyze immediately or refrigerate
    *   **Storage:** Stable for several days refrigerated

*   **Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)**
    *   **Specimen:** Plasma (fluoride oxalate tube)
    *   **Collection**
        *   Patient fasts for 8-12 hours
        *   Baseline sample taken
        *   Patient drinks a standard glucose solution
        *   Samples collected at specific intervals (e.g., 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr)
    *   **Processing:** Centrifuge promptly, analyze immediately or refrigerate

*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)**
    *   **Specimen:** Whole blood (EDTA)
    *   **Collection:** Routine venipuncture, no fasting required
    *   **Processing:** Analyze directly or store refrigerated
    *   **Storage:** Stable for up to a week refrigerated

*   **Urine Glucose**
    *   **Specimen:** Random or timed urine sample
    *   **Collection:** Collect in a clean container
    *   **Processing:** Analyze immediately, as glucose can be consumed by bacteria
    *   **Storage:** If delay is unavoidable, refrigerate, but prompt analysis is best

*   **Ketones**
    *   **Specimen:** Serum, plasma, or urine
    *   **Collection:** Collect in appropriate container
    *   **Processing:** Analyze immediately or refrigerate

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**
    *   **Interference:** Can cause falsely low glucose results with some glucose oxidase methods
    *   **Mechanism:** Ascorbic acid is a reducing agent that interferes with the chromogenic reaction
    *   **Mitigation:** Use glucose oxidase methods that minimize ascorbic acid interference, or hexokinase methods

*   **Bilirubin**
    *   **Interference:** High bilirubin levels can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   **Mechanism:** Bilirubin absorbs light at similar wavelengths, affecting absorbance readings
    *   **Mitigation:** Use methods less susceptible to bilirubin interference, or employ bilirubin correction techniques

*   **Lipemia**
    *   **Interference:** Turbidity from high lipid concentrations can affect spectrophotometric readings
    *   **Mechanism:** Lipids scatter light, leading to inaccurate absorbance measurements
    *   **Mitigation:** Use lipemia clearing techniques (ultracentrifugation, lipid clearing reagents), or consider methods less affected by turbidity

*   **Hemoglobin**
    *   **Interference:** Hemolysis releases hemoglobin, which can interfere with enzymatic reactions
    *   **Mechanism:** Hemoglobin can absorb light and interfere with enzyme activity
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid hemolysis during collection and processing

*   **Urea**
    *   **Interference:** High urea concentrations can interfere with some enzymatic reactions
    *   **Mechanism:** Urea can alter enzyme activity
    *   **Mitigation:** Use methods less susceptible to urea interference

*   **Drugs**
    *   **Interference:** Certain drugs can directly affect glucose levels
    *   **Examples**
        *   Corticosteroids: Increase glucose
        *   Insulin: Decreases glucose
        *   Diuretics: Can increase glucose
    *   **Mitigation:** Be aware of patient's medication list

*   **Hemoglobin Variants**
    *   **Interference:** Can affect HbA1c measurements
    *   **Mechanism:** Some variants don't glycate normally or interfere with antibody binding
    *   **Mitigation:** Use HbA1c methods that are not affected by common variants

*   **Salicylates**
    *   **Interference:** High doses can cause hypoglycemia
    *   **Mechanism:** Increased insulin secretion
    *   **Mitigation:** Consider patient history
