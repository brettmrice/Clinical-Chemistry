# Properties {-}

This section covers the chemical and physical properties of key substance classes in toxicology

## **Alcohols** {-}

*   **Definition:** Organic compounds characterized by one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups
*   **Examples:** Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol
*   **Key Properties**
    *   Polarity: The hydroxyl group makes alcohols polar
    *   Solubility: Short-chain alcohols are miscible with water; solubility decreases with increasing carbon chain length
    *   Boiling Point: Increases with increasing molecular weight and hydrogen bonding
    *   Flammability: Alcohols are flammable
*   **Toxicokinetics**
    *   Rapid absorption
    *   Metabolism: Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
    *   Excretion: Urine and lungs
*   **Toxic Effects**
    *   CNS depression, metabolic acidosis, organ damage

## **Heavy Metals (e.g., Lead)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Metallic elements with relatively high densities that are toxic at low concentrations
*   **Examples:** Lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd)
*   **Key Properties**
    *   Metallic Bonding: Good electrical and thermal conductivity
    *   Variable Oxidation States: Can exist in multiple oxidation states
    *   Complex Formation: Tendency to form complexes with biological molecules
    *   High Density
*   **Toxicokinetics**
    *   Absorption: Varies based on the metal and route
    *   Distribution: Accumulation in specific tissues (e.g., bone, kidneys)
    *   Metabolism: Some undergo biotransformation
    *   Excretion: Primarily urine and feces
*   **Toxic Effects**
    *   Enzyme inhibition, oxidative stress, organ damage, neurological effects

## **Analgesics (e.g., Acetaminophen)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Medications used to relieve pain
*   **Examples:** Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, Opioids
*   **Key Properties**
    *   Structural Diversity: Wide range of chemical classes
    *   Functional Groups: Hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl
    *   Solubility: Varies depending on the specific drug
    *   Acidic or Basic Character
*   **Toxicokinetics**
    *   Variable absorption and distribution
    *   Metabolism: Liver (CYP enzymes)
    *   Excretion: Urine
*   **Toxic Effects**
    *   Liver damage, gastrointestinal effects, respiratory depression

## **Drugs of Abuse** {-}

*   **Definition:** Substances used for non-medical purposes, often for psychoactive effects, which can lead to dependence and addiction
*   **Examples:** Opioids, stimulants, cannabinoids, hallucinogens, depressants
*   **Key Properties**
    *   Structural Diversity: Wide range of chemical classes
    *   Psychoactive Effects: Alter mood, perception, and cognition
    *   Lipophilicity: Many are lipophilic
    *   Solubility: Variable
*   **Toxicokinetics**
    *   Variable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion depending on the drug
*   **Toxic Effects**
    *   Dependence, addiction, organ damage, neurological and cardiovascular effects              |

## **Clinical Significance** {-}

*   **Analytical Method Selection:** Physical and chemical properties influence the choice of analytical methods
*   **Toxic Effects:** These properties influence how the substances are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted, and interact with biological systems, ultimately affecting their toxicity
*   **Sample Preparation:** Understanding these properties helps optimize sample preparation
*   **Exposure Assessment and Risk Evaluation:** Knowing the sources and fate of these chemicals is important for assessing exposure risks
