# Result Interpretation {-}

Interpreting endocrine test results requires careful consideration of various factors, including the patient's clinical presentation, reference intervals, and potential interfering substances

## **General Principles of Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Use appropriate reference intervals for the specific assay and patient population
    *   Reference intervals can vary based on age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic location
*   **Clinical Context**
    *   Interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and other laboratory data
    *   Consider the patient's symptoms, medications, and any coexisting medical conditions
*   **Multiple Tests**
    *   Often, a single hormone measurement is insufficient for diagnosis; multiple tests or dynamic tests may be necessary
    *   Assess the pattern of hormone levels rather than relying on a single value
*   **Interfering Substances**
    *   Be aware of potential interfering substances that can affect hormone measurements (e.g., heterophile antibodies, biotin, medications)
    *   Consider repeating the test using a different method if interference is suspected
*   **Assay Limitations**
    *   Understand the limitations of the specific assay used, including its sensitivity, specificity, and potential for cross-reactivity
    *   Consult with the laboratory or manufacturer for guidance on test interpretation
