# Physiology {-}

Lipid levels and metabolism are crucial for health. Imbalances can lead to a range of disorders, particularly cardiovascular disease

## **Normal States** {-}
*   **Normal Lipid Profile:** Optimal levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL
*   **Balanced Lipid Metabolism:** Efficient breakdown and synthesis of lipids, with appropriate energy storage and utilization


### **Normal Lipid Profile** {-}

*   **Total Cholesterol:** < 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L)
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** < 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L)
*   **HDL Cholesterol:** > 60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L)
*   **Triglycerides:** < 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
*   **Importance**
    *   These levels are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease
    *   Optimal lipid levels contribute to overall health and well-being

    *   High LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides
    *   High LDL cholesterol and high triglycerides

    *   Similar to hyperlipidemia
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease
    *   Management involves lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), medications, and addressing underlying causes

### **Atherosclerosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the buildup of plaque (atheroma) in the arteries
*   **Process**
    1.  Endothelial Injury: Damage to the inner lining of the artery
    2.  Lipid Deposition: LDL cholesterol accumulates in the artery wall
    3.  Inflammation: Immune cells are recruited, leading to chronic inflammation
    4.  Plaque Formation: Plaque consists of lipids, cholesterol, calcium, and cellular debris
    5.  Plaque Rupture: Plaque can rupture, leading to thrombus (blood clot) formation
*   **Risk Factors**
    *   Hyperlipidemia
    *   Hypertension
    *   Smoking
    *   Diabetes
    *   Obesity
    *   Family history
