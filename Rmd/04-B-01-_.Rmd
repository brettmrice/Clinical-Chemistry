# Biochemicals {-}

This section covers the key aspects of vitamins and nutrition - their biochemical roles, metabolic pathways, associated normal and abnormal states, and their fundamental properties

## **Biochemical Theory and Pathways** {-}

*   **Essential Nutrients:** Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for various biochemical processes, but cannot be synthesized adequately by the body
*   **Classification:** Vitamins are classified as either water-soluble (B vitamins, vitamin C) or fat-soluble (vitamins A, D, E, K)
*   **General Metabolic Functions**
    *   **Coenzymes:** Act as coenzymes, essential for enzyme activity in metabolic reactions
    *   **Antioxidants:** Protect cells from damage caused by free radicals
    *   **Hormone-Like Functions:** Some have hormone-like effects, regulating gene expression
*   **Metabolic Pathways and Actions**
    *   **Thiamin (B1):** Coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism
    *   **Riboflavin (B2):** Coenzyme in redox reactions
    *   **Niacin (B3):** Coenzyme in redox reactions
    *   **Pantothenic Acid (B5):** Component of Coenzyme A
    *   **Pyridoxine (B6):** Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism
    *   **Biotin (B7):** Coenzyme in carboxylation reactions
    *   **Folate (B9):** Coenzyme for one-carbon transfer reactions
    *   **Cobalamin (B12):** Coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
    *   **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C):** Antioxidant, collagen synthesis
    *   **Vitamin A:** Vision, cell differentiation, immune function
    *   **Vitamin D:** Calcium and phosphate metabolism
    *   **Vitamin E:** Antioxidant
    *   **Vitamin K:** Blood clotting, bone metabolism
*   **Absorption, Transport, Storage, and Excretion**
    *   **Water-soluble:** Absorbed directly into the bloodstream, not stored significantly, excreted in urine
    *   **Fat-soluble:** Absorbed with dietary fats, stored in the liver and adipose tissue, excreted in bile

## **Normal and Abnormal States** {-}

*   **Normal Nutritional States**
    *   Adequate dietary intake of essential nutrients
    *   Normal absorption and utilization of nutrients
    *   Maintenance of nutrient levels within the normal reference ranges
*   **Malnutrition:** Imbalance resulting from inadequate or excessive nutrient intake
    *   **Undernutrition:** Deficiency of one or more essential nutrients due to inadequate intake, impaired absorption, or increased requirements
    *   **Overnutrition:** Excessive intake of nutrients, leading to nutrient toxicity and adverse health effects
*   **Specific Disorders**
    *   **Vitamin Deficiencies:** Scurvy (C), rickets (D), beriberi (B1), pellagra (B3)
    *   **Vitamin Toxicity:** Liver damage (A), hypercalcemia (D), increased bleeding risk (E)
*   **Assessment**
    *   Dietary assessment, anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests, and clinical assessment are used to determine nutritional status

## **Properties** {-}

*   **Water-Soluble Vitamins**
    *   Soluble in water
    *   Not stored in the body
    *   Less risk of toxicity
    *   Serve as coenzymes in metabolism
*   **Fat-Soluble Vitamins**
    *   Soluble in lipids
    *   Stored in the body
    *   Risk of toxicity
    *   Involved in vision, bone metabolism, and antioxidant functions
*   **Key Chemical Characteristics**
    *   Varied chemical structures influencing their solubility, stability, and interactions with other compounds
*   **Stability and Reactivity**
    *   Susceptible to degradation from heat, light, air, and pH
*   **Active Forms**
    *   Converted into specific coenzymes or active forms to exert their biochemical functions
    
## **Clinical Significance** {-}

*   **Understanding these concepts is vital for**
    *   Diagnosing and managing nutritional disorders effectively
    *   Providing personalized dietary recommendations
    *   Developing public health strategies to prevent deficiencies and toxicities
    *   Interpreting laboratory test results related to vitamin and nutrient status
