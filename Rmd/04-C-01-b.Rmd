# Toxic States {-}

Delving into toxic states within therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is crucial for understanding the factors that lead to toxic drug concentrations and the subsequent adverse effects

## **Toxic States in TDM** {-}

*   **Definition:** A toxic state occurs when the concentration of a drug in the body exceeds the therapeutic range, leading to an increased risk of adverse effects and potential organ damage
*   **Importance of Understanding Toxic States**
    *   Prevents iatrogenic harm
    *   Ensures patient safety
    *   Optimizes drug therapy by identifying and managing factors contributing to toxicity

## **Causes of Toxic States** {-}

*   **Excessive Dosage**
    *   **Prescription Errors:** Incorrect dose prescribed by the physician
    *   **Patient Non-Adherence:** Taking more than the prescribed dose, either intentionally or unintentionally
    *   **Medication Errors:** Dispensing errors by the pharmacy
*   **Impaired Elimination**
    *   **Renal Impairment:** Reduced kidney function decreases renal clearance, leading to drug accumulation
    *   **Hepatic Impairment:** Liver disease decreases hepatic metabolism, resulting in higher drug concentrations
    *   **Heart Failure:** Reduced blood flow to the kidneys and liver impairs drug elimination
*   **Drug Interactions**
    *   **Enzyme Inhibition:** Some drugs inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, leading to increased drug levels
    *   **Protein Binding Displacement:** Drugs can displace other drugs from plasma proteins, increasing the concentration of free (active) drug
    *   **Reduced Absorption:** Drugs can increase the absorption leading to supratherapeutic levels
*   **Patient-Specific Factors**
    *   **Age:** Infants and elderly individuals are more susceptible to toxicity due to immature or declining organ function
    *   **Genetics:** Genetic variations in drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect drug levels
    *   **Disease States:** Certain diseases can affect drug metabolism and elimination
    *   **Pregnancy:** Physiological changes during pregnancy can affect drug pharmacokinetics
