# Therapeutic States {-}

Understanding the interplay between drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic states is essential for effective therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

## **Pharmacokinetics: The Body's Effect on Drugs** {-}

*   **Definition:** The study of how the body affects a drug after administration, including the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)

### **Absorption** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which a drug enters the bloodstream from its site of administration
*   **Factors Affecting Absorption**
    *   **Route of Administration:** Oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, etc
    *   **Drug Formulation:** Tablet, capsule, solution, etc
    *   **Physicochemical Properties of the Drug:** Solubility, ionization, molecular size
    *   **Physiological Factors:** Gastric emptying time, intestinal motility, blood flow, pH
    *   **First-Pass Metabolism:** Metabolism of a drug in the liver before it reaches systemic circulation (for orally administered drugs)
*   **Bioavailability:** The fraction of an administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged
    *   Intravenous administration: Bioavailability is 100%
    *   Oral administration: Bioavailability is often less than 100% due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism

### **Distribution** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which a drug is transported from the bloodstream to various tissues and organs in the body
*   **Factors Affecting Distribution**
    *   **Blood Flow:** Highly perfused organs (brain, heart, liver, kidneys) receive the drug more rapidly
    *   **Tissue Permeability:** Ability of the drug to cross cell membranes and enter tissues
        *   Lipid-soluble drugs can easily cross cell membranes
        *   Water-soluble drugs may require transport proteins
    *   **Protein Binding:** Binding of drugs to plasma proteins (albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein)
        *   Only unbound (free) drug can exert pharmacological effects
        *   Drugs with high protein binding have limited distribution
    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** A measure of the apparent space in the body available to contain the drug
        *   Vd = Dose / Plasma Concentration
        *   High Vd: Indicates extensive tissue distribution
        *   Low Vd: Indicates limited tissue distribution

### **Metabolism** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body chemically alters a drug, usually to make it more water-soluble and easier to excrete
*   **Primary Site:** Liver
*   **Phases of Metabolism**
    *   **Phase I Reactions:** Introduce or expose a functional group on the drug molecule
        *   Oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis
        *   Enzymes: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs)
    *   **Phase II Reactions:** Conjugate a polar molecule to the drug molecule
        *   Glucuronidation, sulfation, acetylation, glutathione conjugation
        *   Enzymes: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs)
*   **Enzyme Induction and Inhibition**
    *   Enzyme Inducers: Increase the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to decreased drug levels
        *   Examples: Rifampin, carbamazepine
    *   Enzyme Inhibitors: Decrease the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to increased drug levels
        *   Examples: Ketoconazole, erythromycin
*   **Prodrugs:** Drugs that are inactive in their administered form and must be metabolized to active metabolites to exert their effects
        *   Examples: Codeine, prednisone

### **Excretion** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body eliminates a drug
*   **Primary Routes**
    *   **Kidneys:** Most drugs are excreted in the urine
        *   Glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, tubular reabsorption
    *   **Liver:** Some drugs are excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces
    *   Other Routes: Lungs, sweat, saliva, breast milk
*   **Factors Affecting Excretion**
    *   **Renal Function:** Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption affect renal drug excretion
    *   **Liver Function:** Bile flow and hepatic metabolism affect biliary drug excretion
    *   **Drug Properties:** Molecular size, ionization, and protein binding affect excretion
*   **Clearance (CL):** A measure of the body's ability to eliminate a drug
    *   CL = Rate of Elimination / Plasma Concentration
    *   High CL: Indicates rapid drug elimination
    *   Low CL: Indicates slow drug elimination

## **Therapeutic States in TDM** {-}

*   **Objective of TDM:** To optimize drug therapy by maintaining drug concentrations within a specific therapeutic range
*   **Therapeutic Range:** The range of drug concentrations associated with a high probability of desired therapeutic effect and a low probability of adverse effects
*   **Factors Influencing the Therapeutic Range**
    *   **Drug Properties:** Potency, selectivity, and therapeutic index
    *   **Patient Factors:** Age, sex, weight, genetics, disease state, and concurrent medications
*   **Therapeutic States**
    *   **Subtherapeutic:** Drug concentration is below the therapeutic range, resulting in inadequate therapeutic effect
    *   **Therapeutic:** Drug concentration is within the therapeutic range, achieving the desired therapeutic effect with minimal adverse effects
    *   **Toxic:** Drug concentration is above the therapeutic range, increasing the risk of adverse effects
    *   **Supratherapeutic:** Drug concentration is above the therapeutic range, but not necessarily associated with toxicity
        *   Supratherapeutic levels may be intentional in certain situations (e.g., antibiotic dosing for severe infections)

### **Subtherapeutic State** {-}

*   **Definition:** Drug concentration is below the therapeutic range, resulting in inadequate therapeutic effect
*   **Causes**
    *   Inadequate Dose: The prescribed dose is too low
    *   Poor Adherence: The patient is not taking the medication as prescribed
    *   Drug Interactions: Other medications or substances are decreasing drug levels
    *   Rapid Metabolism: The patient is metabolizing the drug too quickly
    *   Increased Clearance: The patient's kidneys are eliminating the drug too quickly
    *   Malabsorption: Drug is not adequately absorbed in the GI tract
*   **Consequences**
    *   Lack of therapeutic effect: The drug is not effectively treating the condition
    *   Disease progression: The condition may worsen due to lack of treatment
    *   Development of resistance: In the case of antibiotics, subtherapeutic levels can promote the development of drug-resistant bacteria
*   **Management**
    *   Increase the dose
    *   Improve adherence through patient education and support
    *   Adjust the dosing interval
    *   Avoid or manage drug interactions
