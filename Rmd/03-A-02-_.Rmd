# Procedures {-}

Reliable blood gas analysis is essential for assessing a patient's respiratory and metabolic health

## **Analytical Principles** {-}

*   Blood gas measurements assess pH, oxygen (Pa$O_2$), and carbon dioxide (Pa$CO_2$) levels
    *   pH: Potentiometric measurement using a pH-sensitive electrode
    *   Pa$O_2$: Amperometric measurement using a Clark electrode
    *   Pa$CO_2$: Potentiometric measurement using a Severinghaus electrode
*   Bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) is calculated, not measured directly, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
*   Some analyzers measure electrolytes ($Na^+$, $K^+$, $Cl^-$, $Ca^{2+}$) using ion-selective electrodes

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   Patient Preparation
    *   Steady state: Ensure the patient's condition and therapy have stabilized
    *   Supplemental oxygen: Document the patient's oxygen level
*   Specimen Collection
    *   Arterial sample preferred: For accurate assessment of oxygen and acid-base status
    *   Site selection: Radial artery is common due to collateral circulation
    *   Technique:
        *   Perform Modified Allen Test
        *   Use correct needle angle
        *   Prevent air bubbles
        *   Proper mixing: Promptly mix specimen
    *   Syringe Type: Pre-heparinized syringe

## **Specimen Handling and Processing** {-}

*   Timing: Analyze promptly (within 15-30 minutes) or store on ice to slow metabolism
*   Storage: If delay is unavoidable, store on ice (analyze within 1-2 hours)
*   Air Exposure: Prevent air exposure
*   Clotting: Reject clotted samples

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   Air Contamination
    *   Falsely elevates Pa$O_2$, decreases Pa$CO_2$
*   Excess Heparin
    *   Lowers pH
*   Metabolic Activity
    *   Decreases Pa$O_2$, increases Pa$CO_2$
*   Temperature: Affects gas solubility and electrode function
*   High Bilirubin or Lipids: Affect electrode measurements
*   Calibration Errors: Inaccurate results

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   Unexpected Results
    *   Check patient preparation
    *   Review collection/processing
    *   Evaluate reagent quality
    *   Consider interferences
    *   Repeat the test
*   Out-of-Control QC
    *   Check QC materials
    *   Recalibrate the instrument
    *   Review reagents
*   Inconsistent Results
    *   Check electrode performance
    *   Perform instrument maintenance
