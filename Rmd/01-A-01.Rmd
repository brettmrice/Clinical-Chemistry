Carbohydrates are our body's primary fuel source, and their metabolism is a vital process. It's all about how we break down, build, and store these sugars to keep our energy levels stable

## **Key Metabolic Pathways:** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source, with glucose being the central player. Their metabolism is a carefully orchestrated series of pathways ensuring a constant energy supply and building blocks for other molecules

    *   **Glycolysis:** The breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, yielding ATP and NADH. Occurs in the cytoplasm. The fate of pyruvate depends on oxygen availability (aerobic vs. anaerobic)
    *   **Gluconeogenesis:** The synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (lactate, glycerol, amino acids). Primarily occurs in the liver during fasting. It helps to maintain blood glucose levels
    *   **Glycogenesis:** The conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage, primarily in the liver and muscles. A way to store excess glucose
    *   **Glycogenolysis:** The breakdown of glycogen to release glucose when needed
    *   **Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP):** Produces NADPH (for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense) and ribose-5-phosphate (for nucleotide synthesis)

*   **Regulation:** These pathways are tightly regulated by hormones (insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol) and allosteric effectors (ATP, AMP, etc.) to maintain glucose homeostasis

## **Normal and Abnormal States** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** Disruptions in carbohydrate metabolism lead to a range of diseases, most notably diabetes mellitus

    *   **Normal State: Normoglycemia**

        *   Fasting glucose: 70-99 mg/dL (3.9-5.5 mmol/L)
        *   Postprandial glucose: <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
        *   Maintained by hormonal balance and efficient metabolic pathways

    *   **Abnormal States:**

        *   **Hyperglycemia:** Elevated blood glucose
            *   **Causes:** Diabetes mellitus (Type 1, Type 2, gestational), other endocrine disorders, medications, stress
            *   **Complications:** Acute (DKA, HHS) and chronic (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease)
        *   **Hypoglycemia:** Low blood glucose
            *   **Causes:** Excess insulin, liver disease, kidney disease, hormone deficiencies, alcohol consumption
            *   **Complications:** Neurological symptoms, seizures, coma, brain damage
        *   **Insulin Resistance:** Cells don't respond properly to insulin
            *   **Consequences:** Hyperinsulinemia, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome
        *   **Genetic Disorders:**
            *   **Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSDs):** Enzyme deficiencies in glycogen metabolism
            *   **Galactosemia:** Impaired galactose metabolism
            *   **Hereditary Fructose Intolerance:** Impaired fructose metabolism
            *   **Pentosuria:** Excess excretion of pentoses in the urine

## **Physical and Chemical Properties** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** The structure of carbohydrates dictates their physical properties (solubility, taste) and chemical reactivity (oxidation, hydrolysis)

    *   **Monosaccharides:**
        *   Crystalline solids, water-soluble, sweet
        *   Cyclization (anomers), oxidation (reducing sugars), esterification, glycoside formation
        *   Examples: Glucose, fructose, galactose, ribose
    *   **Disaccharides:**
        *   Crystalline solids, water-soluble, sweet
        *   Hydrolyzed by enzymes or acid
        *   Can be reducing (lactose, maltose) or non-reducing (sucrose)
    *   **Polysaccharides:**
        *   Amorphous or fibrous, mostly insoluble, generally tasteless
        *   Hydrolyzed by enzymes or acid
        *   Vary in structure (linear vs. branched) and composition (homo- vs. heteropolysaccharides)
        *   Examples: Starch, glycogen, cellulose
