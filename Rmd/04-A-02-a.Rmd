# Principles {-}

Understanding the analytical principles behind endocrinology laboratory tests is critical for ensuring accurate and reliable results. Fluorescence and immunoassay techniques are commonly used

## **Fluorescence Assays** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   **Fluorescence:** is a phenomenon in which a molecule (fluorophore) absorbs light at a specific wavelength (excitation wavelength) and emits light at a longer wavelength (emission wavelength)
    *   The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of the fluorophore
    *   Fluorescence assays are highly sensitive and specific, making them useful for measuring low concentrations of hormones
*   **Components**
    *   **Light Source:** Provides the excitation light (e.g., xenon lamp, laser)
    *   **Excitation Filter:** Selects the excitation wavelength
    *   **Sample:** Contains the hormone to be measured, labeled with a fluorophore
    *   **Emission Filter:** Selects the emission wavelength
    *   **Detector:** Measures the intensity of the emitted light (e.g., photomultiplier tube, photodiode)
*   **Types of Fluorescence Assays**
    *   **Direct Fluorescence Assay**
        *   The hormone itself is labeled with a fluorophore
        *   The intensity of the emitted light is measured directly
    *   **Indirect Fluorescence Assay**
        *   A secondary reagent labeled with a fluorophore binds to the hormone
        *   The intensity of the emitted light is measured indirectly
    *   **Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA)**
        *   Based on the change in polarization of emitted light
        *   Small fluorescently labeled hormone molecules emit light with rapid depolarization
        *   When the labeled hormone binds to antibodies, the resulting complex rotates more slowly, emitting light with increased polarization
        *   The degree of polarization is inversely proportional to the concentration of the hormone
    *   **Time-Resolved Fluorescence Immunoassay (TR-FIA)**
        *   Uses lanthanide chelates as fluorophores
        *   Lanthanide chelates have long emission lifetimes, allowing for time-resolved measurements
        *   Background fluorescence is minimized by measuring the emission after a delay period
        *   TR-FIA is highly sensitive and specific
*   **Applications in Endocrinology**
    *   **Thyroid Hormones:** Measurement of T3 and T4
    *   **Steroid Hormones:** Measurement of cortisol, estradiol, and testosterone
    *   **Peptide Hormones:** Measurement of insulin and growth hormone
*   **Advantages**
    *   High sensitivity
    *   High specificity
    *   Relatively simple instrumentation
    *   Wide range of applications
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Susceptible to interference from fluorescent compounds in the sample (autofluorescence)
    *   Photobleaching of the fluorophore
    *   Quenching of fluorescence by other molecules

## **Immunoassays** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   **Immunoassays:** are based on the specific binding of antibodies to antigens (or haptens)
        *   The hormone to be measured acts as the antigen
        *   The amount of hormone is determined by measuring the amount of antibody-antigen complex formed
*   **Components**
    *   **Antibody:** A protein produced by the immune system that binds to a specific antigen
    *   **Antigen:** The hormone to be measured
    *   **Label:** A molecule that is attached to the antibody or antigen to allow for detection
    *   **Detection System:** Measures the amount of label bound to the antibody-antigen complex
*   **Types of Immunoassays**
    *   **Competitive Immunoassay**
        *   Unlabeled hormone in the sample competes with labeled hormone for binding to a limited number of antibodies
        *   The amount of labeled hormone bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of unlabeled hormone in the sample
        *   **Applications:** Measurement of small hormones, such as steroid hormones and thyroid hormones
    *   **Non-Competitive Immunoassay (Sandwich Immunoassay)**
        *   Two antibodies are used: a capture antibody and a detection antibody
        *   The capture antibody binds to the hormone in the sample
        *   The detection antibody, which is labeled, binds to a different epitope on the hormone
        *   The amount of labeled antibody bound to the hormone is directly proportional to the concentration of the hormone in the sample
        *   **Applications:** Measurement of large hormones, such as peptide hormones and protein hormones
    *   **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)**
        *   A type of immunoassay that uses an enzyme as the label
        *   The enzyme converts a substrate to a detectable product, such as a colored compound
        *   **Applications:** Measurement of a wide range of hormones
    *   **Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA)**
        *   A type of immunoassay that uses a chemiluminescent compound as the label
        *   The chemiluminescent compound emits light when it undergoes a chemical reaction
        *   The amount of light emitted is proportional to the concentration of the hormone
        *   **Applications:** Measurement of hormones requiring high sensitivity
    *   **Radioimmunoassay (RIA)**
        *   A type of immunoassay that uses a radioactive isotope as the label
        *   The amount of radioactivity is measured to determine the concentration of the hormone
        *   **Applications:** Historically used for many hormones, but now less common due to safety concerns and regulatory requirements
*   **Applications in Endocrinology**
    *   **Thyroid Hormones:** Measurement of T3, T4, and TSH
    *   **Steroid Hormones:** Measurement of cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone
    *   **Peptide Hormones:** Measurement of insulin, growth hormone, prolactin, FSH, LH, ACTH, PTH, and hCG
*   **Advantages**
    *   High sensitivity
    *   High specificity
    *   Wide range of applications
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Susceptible to interference from heterophile antibodies and other factors
    *   Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds
    *   Requirement for specific antibodies
