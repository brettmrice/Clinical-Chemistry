# pH and [H<sup>+</sup>] {-}

Understanding the relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration is fundamental to understanding acid-base balance

## **pH and Hydrogen Ion Concentration [$H^+$]** {-}

*   **Acids and Bases**
    *   Acids: Substances that donate hydrogen ions ($H^+$) in solution
    *   Bases: Substances that accept hydrogen ions ($H^+$) in solution
*   **pH Definition:** The pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration:

$$pH = -log [H^+] = -log [H_3O^+]$$

*   **Hydrogen Ion Concentration [$H^+$]**
    *   The hydrogen ion concentration [$H^+$] refers to the amount of hydrogen ions present in a solution
    *   [$H^+$] is typically expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L) or nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)
*   **Relationship Between pH and [$H^+$]**
    *   Inverse Relationship: pH and [$H^+$] are inversely related. As [$H^+$] increases, pH decreases, and as [$H^+$] decreases, pH increases
    *   Acidic Solutions: Have a high [$H^+$] and a low pH (pH < 7)
    *   Basic Solutions: Have a low [$H^+$] and a high pH (pH > 7)
    *   Neutral Solutions: Have a [$H^+$] equal to the [$OH^-$] and a pH of 7
*   **The pH Scale**
    *   The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14
    *   pH 0-7: Acidic
    *   pH 7: Neutral
    *   pH 7-14: Basic (alkaline)
*   **Normal Physiological pH**
    *   Arterial Blood: 7.35-7.45
    *   Venous Blood: 7.32-7.42
    *   Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): 7.35-7.40
    *   Intracellular Fluid: Varies depending on the cell type, but typically slightly lower than extracellular fluid
*   **Importance of Maintaining Physiological pH**
    *   Enzyme Activity: Most enzymes function optimally within a narrow pH range
    *   Protein Structure: pH affects the ionization state of amino acids, which influences protein folding and stability
    *   Oxygen Transport: pH affects the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen
    *   Electrolyte Balance: pH affects the distribution and transport of electrolytes
    *   Cellular Metabolism: pH influences various metabolic processes
*   **Calculations Involving pH and [$H^+$]**
    *   Calculating pH from [$H^+$]: $pH = -log[H^+]$
    *   Calculating [$H^+$] from pH: $[H^+] = 10^{(-pH)}$

*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**
    *   This equation relates pH to the concentrations of bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) in the blood:
$$pH = 6.1 + \log \left( \frac{[HCO_3^-]}{0.03 \times pCO_2} \right)$$
        *   $pH$: Blood pH
        *   $pKa$: Dissociation constant (e.g. carbonic acid $pKa$ = 6.1)
        *   \[$HCO_3^-$]: Bicarbonate concentration (mmol/L)
        *   0.03 is a solubility coefficient, converting Pa$CO_2$ to dissolved $CO_2$
        *   Pa$CO_2$: Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mmHg)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to assess acid-base disturbances
    *   Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis measures pH, Pa$CO_2$, and $HCO_3^-$, allowing for the diagnosis and classification of acid-base disorders
*   **Acid-Base Imbalances**
    *   Acidosis: A condition in which the blood pH is below 7.35
        *   Increased [$H^+$]
    *   Alkalosis: A condition in which the blood pH is above 7.45
        *   Decreased [$H^+$]
