# Properties {-}

The physical and chemical properties of heme derivatives are essential for their function in oxygen transport, electron transfer, and detoxification

## **Hemoglobin** {-}

*   **Definition:** A protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs
*   **Structure**
    *   Tetrameric Protein: Consists of four polypeptide chains (globins)
    *   Two α Chains and Two β Chains: In adult hemoglobin (HbA), each chain is linked to a heme group
    *   Heme Group: A porphyrin ring with a central iron atom (Fe2+ in the functional state)
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   Color: Red when oxygenated (oxyhemoglobin), bluish-red when deoxygenated (deoxyhemoglobin)
    *   Solubility: Soluble in water within red blood cells
    *   Molecular Weight: Approximately 64,000 Da
    *   Quaternary Structure: Tetrameric structure allows for cooperative binding of oxygen
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   Oxygen Binding: Iron atom in heme binds reversibly to oxygen
        *   Oxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin bound to oxygen
        *   Deoxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin without oxygen
    *   Carbon Dioxide Binding: Hemoglobin can also bind to carbon dioxide and transport it back to the lungs
    *   Allosteric Regulation: Oxygen binding is affected by pH, carbon dioxide, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)
    *   Methemoglobin Formation: Iron can be oxidized to Fe3+, forming methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen
    *   Carbaminohemoglobin Formation: Carbon dioxide can bind to amino groups in hemoglobin, forming carbaminohemoglobin

## **Myoglobin** {-}

*   **Definition:** A protein found in muscle cells that stores oxygen and facilitates oxygen diffusion
*   **Structure**
    *   Monomeric Protein: Consists of a single polypeptide chain (globin)
    *   Heme Group: A porphyrin ring with a central iron atom (Fe2+ in the functional state)
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   Color: Red
    *   Solubility: Soluble in water within muscle cells
    *   Molecular Weight: Approximately 17,000 Da
    *   Tertiary Structure: Globular protein with a hydrophobic pocket for the heme group
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   Oxygen Binding: Iron atom in heme binds reversibly to oxygen
        *   Oxymyoglobin: Myoglobin bound to oxygen
        *   Deoxymyoglobin: Myoglobin without oxygen
    *   Higher Oxygen Affinity: Myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin, allowing it to store oxygen in muscles
    *   Not Affected by Allosteric Regulators: Oxygen binding is not significantly affected by pH, carbon dioxide, or 2,3-BPG

## **Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Definition:** A yellow pigment produced from the breakdown of heme
*   **Types**
    *   Unconjugated Bilirubin (Indirect): Insoluble in water, transported in blood bound to albumin
    *   Conjugated Bilirubin (Direct): Water-soluble, conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver
*   **Structure**
    *   Tetrapyrrole Ring: A linear chain of four pyrrole rings
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   Color: Yellow
    *   Solubility:
        *   Unconjugated: Insoluble in water
        *   Conjugated: Soluble in water
    *   Light Sensitivity: Bilirubin is degraded by light
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   Formation from Heme: Produced by heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase
    *   Conjugation: Conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) in the liver, making it water-soluble
    *   Excretion: Secreted into bile and excreted in feces
    *   Diazo Reaction: Reacts with diazonium salts to form a colored product (used in laboratory assays)
    *   Phototherapy: Blue light converts bilirubin to more soluble isomers that can be excreted in urine (used in treating neonatal jaundice)

## **Urobilinogen** {-}

*   **Definition:** A colorless compound produced in the intestine by bacterial reduction of bilirubin
*   **Structure**
    *   Tetrapyrrole Ring: Similar to bilirubin, but more reduced
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   Color: Colorless
    *   Solubility: Soluble in water
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   Formation from Bilirubin: Produced by bacterial reduction of bilirubin in the intestine
    *   Oxidation to Urobilin: Urobilinogen can be oxidized to urobilin, a brown pigment
    *   Excretion:
        *   Most of the urobilinogen is excreted in feces as stercobilin (gives feces its brown color)
        *   A small amount is reabsorbed and excreted in urine as urobilin (gives urine its yellow color)
    *   Ehrlich's Reagent: Reacts with Ehrlich's reagent (p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde) to form a colored product (used in laboratory assays)

## **Porphyrins** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of cyclic tetrapyrrole compounds that are intermediates in heme synthesis
*   **Types**
    *   Uroporphyrin
    *   Coproporphyrin
    *   Protoporphyrin
*   **Structure**
    *   Cyclic Tetrapyrrole Ring: Four pyrrole rings linked by methene bridges
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   Color: Highly colored compounds, exhibiting fluorescence
    *   Solubility: Varies depending on the specific porphyrin and its substituents
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   Heme Precursors: Intermediates in the synthesis of heme
    *   Metal Binding: Can bind to metal ions, such as iron
    *   Fluorescence: Exhibit fluorescence under UV light, allowing for detection and quantification
    *   Acid Extraction: Can be extracted from biological samples using acidic solutions
    *   Porphyria Markers: Accumulation of specific porphyrins in urine, blood, or feces is indicative of porphyria
