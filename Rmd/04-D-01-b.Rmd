# Metabolism, Excretion {-}

Understanding the processes of metabolism and excretion is crucial in toxicology

## **Drug Metabolism** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body chemically alters a toxic substance, often to facilitate its elimination
*   **Primary Site of Metabolism:** Liver
*   **Other Sites:** Kidneys, intestines, lungs, and plasma
*   **Purpose of Metabolism**
    *   Convert lipid-soluble toxic substances into more water-soluble metabolites, facilitating their excretion in the urine
    *   Detoxify by converting toxic substances into less harmful metabolites
    *   Bioactivation: Convert relatively harmless substances into more toxic metabolites
*   **Phases of Metabolism**
    *   Phase I Reactions: Introduce or expose a functional group on the toxic substance molecule through oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis
    *   Phase II Reactions: Conjugate a polar molecule to the toxic substance molecule, such as glucuronic acid, sulfate, or glutathione

### **Phase I Metabolism** {-}

*   **Oxidation**
    *   Addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen atoms from the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes
    *   Examples of reactions: Hydroxylation, epoxidation, N-oxidation, S-oxidation
*   **Reduction**
    *   Addition of hydrogen atoms or electrons to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Reductases
    *   Examples of reactions: Reduction of nitro groups, azo groups, and carbonyl groups
*   **Hydrolysis**
    *   Addition of water to break a chemical bond
    *   Enzymes involved: Esterases, amidases, peptidases
    *   Examples of reactions: Hydrolysis of esters, amides, and peptides

### **Phase II Metabolism** {-}

*   **Glucuronidation**
    *   Addition of glucuronic acid to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)
    *   Results in highly water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted in the urine
*   **Sulfation**
    *   Addition of a sulfate group to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Sulfotransferases (SULTs)
    *   Results in water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted in the urine
*   **Acetylation**
    *   Addition of an acetyl group to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: N-acetyltransferases (NATs)
    *   Genetic polymorphisms in NAT enzymes can affect the metabolism of some toxic substances
*   **Glutathione Conjugation**
    *   Addition of glutathione to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)
    *   Important for detoxifying reactive metabolites, such as those formed during acetaminophen metabolism
*   **Methylation**
    *   Addition of a methyl group to the toxic substance molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Methyltransferases
    *   Can either activate or inactivate drugs

### **Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes** {-}

*   **Definition:** A superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze the oxidation of many drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds
*   **Location:** Primarily in the liver, but also present in other tissues
*   **Importance in Toxicology:** Responsible for the metabolism of many toxic substances
*   **Key CYP Enzymes**
    *   CYP3A4: Metabolizes the largest number of drugs and toxins
    *   CYP2D6: Metabolizes many psychiatric and cardiovascular drugs
    *   CYP2C9: Metabolizes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warfarin
    *   CYP2E1: Metabolizes ethanol, acetaminophen, and some volatile organic compounds

### **Factors Affecting Drug Metabolism** {-}

*   **Genetic Factors**
    *   Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect the rate of metabolism
    *   Individuals can be classified as poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, or ultra-rapid metabolizers
*   **Age**
    *   Infants have immature metabolic enzyme systems
    *   Elderly individuals may have decreased liver function and reduced enzyme activity
*   **Disease States**
    *   Liver disease: Reduces metabolic enzyme activity
    *   Kidney disease: Affects drug clearance and can lead to drug accumulation
*   **Drug Interactions**
    *   Enzyme Inducers: Increase the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to decreased levels of toxicant
    *   Enzyme Inhibitors: Decrease the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to increased levels of toxicant
*   **Diet and Environmental Factors**
    *   Grapefruit juice: Inhibits CYP3A4
    *   Smoking: Induces CYP1A2
*   **Gender**
    *   Differences in hormone levels and body composition can affect drug metabolism

## **Excretion** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body eliminates a toxic substance or its metabolites
*   **Primary Routes of Excretion**
    *   Kidneys: Most toxic substances are excreted in the urine
    *   Liver: Some toxic substances are excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces
*   **Other Routes:** Lungs, sweat, saliva, breast milk
*   **Renal Excretion**
    *   Glomerular Filtration: Toxic substances and small molecules are filtered from the blood into the renal tubules
        *   Only unbound (free) substance can be filtered
    *   Tubular Secretion: Active transport of toxic substances from the blood into the renal tubules
        *   Can be affected by drug interactions
    *   Tubular Reabsorption: Passive or active transport of toxic substances from the renal tubules back into the blood
        *   Lipid-soluble toxic substances are more readily reabsorbed
        *   Urine pH can affect the reabsorption of weak acids and bases
*   **Biliary Excretion**
    *   Toxic substances and metabolites are transported from the liver into the bile
    *   Bile is secreted into the small intestine and eliminated in the feces
    *   Some toxic substances undergo enterohepatic circulation, where they are reabsorbed from the intestine back into the blood
*   **Clearance (CL)**
    *   A measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating a toxic substance from the body
    *   Total Clearance: Sum of all clearance pathways (renal, hepatic, and other)
    *   Renal Clearance: The volume of plasma from which a toxic substance is completely removed by the kidneys per unit of time
    *   Hepatic Clearance: The volume of plasma from which a toxic substance is completely removed by the liver per unit of time
*   **Factors Affecting Excretion**
    *   Renal Function: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption affect renal excretion
    *   Liver Function: Bile flow and hepatic metabolism affect biliary excretion
    *   Substance Properties: Molecular size, ionization, and protein binding affect excretion
    *   Drug Interactions: Some drugs can affect the excretion of other substances
    *   Urine pH: Can influence the excretion of weak acids and bases
