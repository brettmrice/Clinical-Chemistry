# Procedures {-}

This section covers the various aspects of toxicology lab procedures

## **General Principles of Toxicology Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Objective:** To identify and quantify toxic substances in biological samples for clinical, forensic, and environmental purposes
*   **Scope:** Encompasses a wide range of analytes, including drugs, poisons, heavy metals, and environmental toxins
*   **Types of Assays**
    *   Screening Assays: Provide rapid, qualitative detection of substances or classes of substances
    *   Confirmatory Assays: Provide quantitative identification and confirmation of specific substances
*   **Sample Types**
    *   Blood, urine, gastric contents, tissues, hair, oral fluid, and other specimens

## **Analytical Principles** {-}

*   **Immunoassays (IAs)**
    *   Principle: Based on antibody-antigen binding
    *   Types: ELISA, FPIA, CLIA
    *   Advantages: High throughput, ease of use
    *   Limitations: Cross-reactivity, limited quantitative accuracy
*   **Chromatography (GC, HPLC)**
    *   Principle: Separates compounds based on physical and chemical properties
    *   Detectors: UV-Vis, fluorescence, electrochemical, mass spectrometry (MS)
    *   Advantages: High resolution, quantitative analysis
    *   Limitations: Requires skilled operators
*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**
    *   Principle: Identifies and quantifies compounds based on mass-to-charge ratio
    *   Techniques: GC-MS, LC-MS/MS
    *   Advantages: High sensitivity and specificity, can identify unknowns
    *   Limitations: Requires expensive equipment and highly skilled operators
*   **Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)**
    *   Principle: Measures light absorption by free atoms
    *   Application: Heavy metal analysis
    *   Advantages: High sensitivity for minerals
    *   Limitations: Requires specialized equipment, matrix effects
*   **Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)**
    *   Principle: Measures mass-to-charge ratio of ions in plasma
    *   Application: Trace elements, heavy metals
    *   Advantages: High sensitivity, multi-element analysis
    *   Limitations: Requires specialized equipment, matrix effects

*   **Documentation**
    *   Procedures, results, QC data, maintenance logs
*   **Security**
    *   Controlled substances stored securely
    *   Limited access

## **Specimen Collection and Processing** {-}

*   **General Guidelines**
    *   Sample Integrity: Proper containers to prevent contamination
    *   Volume: Collect adequate volume
    *   Timeliness: Process promptly
*   **Specific Specimen Types**
    *   Blood: Gray-top for alcohol, avoid hemolysis
    *   Urine: Random or timed, preservatives if needed
    *   Gastric Contents: Collect as soon as possible
    *   Tissues: Collect during autopsy or biopsy
    *   Hair: Collect close to scalp, wash and segment
    *   Oral Fluid: Use specialized collection devices

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Unexpected Results**
    *   Verify patient ID
    *   Repeat the test
    *   Check for interferences
    *   Review history
    *   Consider alternative methods
*   **Quality Control (QC) Failures**
    *   Out-of-Range QC
    *   Calibration Issues
    *   Reagent Problems
