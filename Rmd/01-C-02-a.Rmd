# Principles {-}

Labs play a critical role in diagnosing and monitoring conditions related to heme metabolism. Tests include bilirubin, iron studies, porphyrins, and more

*   **Key Tests**
    *   Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect)
    *   Urine Bilirubin
    *   Fecal Bilirubin
    *   Iron Studies (Serum Iron, TIBC, Transferrin Saturation, Ferritin)
    *   Porphyrins (Urine, Blood, Fecal)
    *   Lead

## **Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Principle:** The Diazo Reaction is the basis for most bilirubin assays. Bilirubin reacts with a diazonium salt (e.g., diazotized sulfanilic acid) in an acidic solution to form a colored azobilirubin pigment, which is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Types of Bilirubin Measured**
    *   Total Bilirubin: Measures both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin
    *   Direct Bilirubin: Measures conjugated bilirubin directly (reacts with diazo reagent in aqueous solution)
    *   Indirect Bilirubin: Calculated by subtracting direct bilirubin from total bilirubin (represents unconjugated bilirubin)
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Bilirubin + Diazotized Sulfanilic Acid → Azobilirubin (Colored Product)
*   **Enhancers/Accelerators:** To measure total bilirubin, a reagent such as methanol or caffeine is added to solubilize the unconjugated bilirubin, allowing it to react with the diazo reagent
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored azobilirubin product is directly proportional to the bilirubin concentration in the sample and is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** Widely available, relatively inexpensive, and well-established method
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from lipemia, hemolysis, and certain medications

## **Urine Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Principle:** The Diazo Reaction is used. Bilirubin in urine reacts with a diazonium salt to form a colored product
*   **Method:** Dipstick or Ictotest tablets
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Bilirubin + Diazonium Salt → Colored Product
*   **Detection:** The color change on the dipstick or tablet is compared to a color chart to estimate the bilirubin concentration in the urine
*   **Advantages:** Rapid and simple screening test
*   **Disadvantages:** Less sensitive than serum bilirubin assays, only detects conjugated bilirubin, susceptible to false negatives from ascorbic acid (vitamin C)

## **Fecal Bilirubin** {-}

*   **Principle:** Quantitative measurement of fecal bilirubin is not routinely performed. However, the presence or absence of bilirubin breakdown products (urobilinogen and stercobilin) can be assessed
*   **Method:** Chemical tests to detect urobilinogen and stercobilin
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Urobilinogen + Ehrlich's Reagent → Pink-Red Color
*   **Detection:** The presence of a colored product indicates the presence of urobilinogen and stercobilin
*   **Advantages:** Can provide information about bile flow and intestinal function
*   **Disadvantages:** Not quantitative, affected by diet and medications

## **Iron Studies** {-}

*   **Principle:** A panel of tests used to evaluate iron metabolism and storage
*   **Tests Included**
    *   Serum Iron: Measures the amount of iron bound to transferrin in the blood
    *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): Measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by transferrin
    *   Transferrin Saturation: Calculated as (Serum Iron / TIBC) x 100
    *   Ferritin: Measures the amount of iron stored in tissues

### **Serum Iron** {-}

*   **Principle:** Iron is released from transferrin by an acidic buffer and reduced to Fe2+. The Fe2+ reacts with a chromogen to form a colored complex, which is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Transferrin-Fe3+ + Acidic Buffer → Transferrin + Fe3+
    2.  Fe3+ + Reducing Agent → Fe2+
    3.  Fe2+ + Chromogen → Colored Complex
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored complex is directly proportional to the iron concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Widely available and relatively inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Affected by diurnal variation and recent iron intake

### **Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Excess iron is added to saturate all binding sites on transferrin. The unbound iron is removed, and the total iron is then measured using a similar method to serum iron
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Transferrin + Excess Fe3+ → Transferrin-Fe3+ (Saturated)
    2.  Removal of Unbound Fe3+
    3.  Transferrin-Fe3+ + Acidic Buffer → Transferrin + Fe3+
    4.  Fe3+ + Reducing Agent → Fe2+
    5.  Fe2+ + Chromogen → Colored Complex
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored complex is directly proportional to the TIBC
*   **Advantages:** Provides an estimate of transferrin concentration
*   **Disadvantages:** More complex than serum iron measurement

### **Transferrin Saturation** {-}

*   **Principle:** Calculated from serum iron and TIBC
    *   Transferrin Saturation = (Serum Iron / TIBC) x 100
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Low Transferrin Saturation: Suggests iron deficiency
    *   High Transferrin Saturation: Suggests iron overload

### **Ferritin** {-}

*   **Principle:** Immunochemical methods (e.g., ELISA, chemiluminescence) are used to measure ferritin. Antibodies specific to ferritin are used to capture and quantify the ferritin in a blood sample
*   **Methods**
    *   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
    *   Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA)
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Ferritin + Ferritin-Specific Antibody → Antibody-Ferritin Complex
*   **Detection:** The amount of antibody-ferritin complex formed is measured, and is proportional to the ferritin concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Specific and sensitive
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be affected by inflammation

## **Porphyrins** {-}

*   **Principle:** Porphyrins are extracted from urine, blood, or feces and separated by chromatography. They are then quantified by spectrophotometry or fluorometry
*   **Methods**
    *   Spectrophotometry
    *   Fluorometry
    *   High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Extraction: Porphyrins are extracted from the sample using organic solvents
    2.  Separation: Porphyrins are separated by HPLC based on their chemical properties
    3.  Detection: Porphyrins are detected and quantified by measuring their absorbance or fluorescence
*   **Advantages:** Can identify and quantify specific porphyrins
*   **Disadvantages:** Complex and requires specialized equipment
*   **Urine Porphyrins**: Reflects porphyrin excretion
*   **Blood Porphyrins**: Detects porphyrins present in blood
*   **Fecal Porphyrins**: Measures porphyrin excretion in feces

## **Lead** {-}

*   **Principle:** Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used to measure lead in whole blood
*   **Methods**
    *   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)
    *   Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
*   **Procedure**
    1.  Sample Preparation: Blood is treated to release lead
    2.  Analysis: The sample is introduced into the instrument, and lead is measured based on its absorption or emission of light
*   **Advantages:** Highly sensitive and accurate
*   **Disadvantages:** Requires specialized equipment and trained personnel
