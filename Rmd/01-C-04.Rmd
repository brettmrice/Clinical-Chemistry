## **Liver Diseases** {-}
*   Hepatitis (Viral, Alcoholic, Drug-Induced)
*   Cirrhosis
*   Biliary Obstruction (Gallstones, Tumors)

### **Hepatitis (Viral, Alcoholic, Drug-Induced)** {-}
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Elevated Total Bilirubin: Typically > 1.0 mg/dL
    *   Elevated Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin: Increased proportion of direct bilirubin
    *   Elevated Liver Enzymes: ALT and AST (indicators of liver inflammation/damage)
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Liver inflammation impairs bilirubin conjugation and excretion, leading to hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes
    *   Specific patterns of bilirubin and liver enzyme elevation can help differentiate between different types of hepatitis
    
### **Cirrhosis** {-}
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Elevated Total Bilirubin: Variable, may be normal in early stages
    *   Elevated Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin: Increased proportion of direct bilirubin
    *   Elevated Liver Enzymes: Variable, may be normal or decreased in advanced stages
    *   Decreased Albumin: Indicator of impaired liver synthetic function
    *   Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT): Indicator of impaired liver synthetic function
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count due to portal hypertension and splenomegaly
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Cirrhosis is characterized by chronic liver damage and scarring, leading to impaired bilirubin metabolism, decreased protein synthesis, and other complications
    *   Elevated bilirubin, decreased albumin, and prolonged PT reflect the severity of liver dysfunction
    
### **Biliary Obstruction (Gallstones, Tumors)** {-}
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Elevated Total Bilirubin: Typically > 2.0 mg/dL
    *   Elevated Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin: Predominantly direct bilirubin
    *   Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT): Indicators of biliary obstruction

    *   Elevated Transferrin Saturation: > 50%
    *   Elevated Ferritin: > 200 ng/mL (women), > 500 ng/mL (men)
    *   Decreased Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): < 240 μg/dL (42.9 μmol/L)
*   **Disease State Correlation**
*   Excessive iron absorption leads to iron overload, causing tissue damage and organ dysfunction

## **Lead Poisoning** {-}

*   **Definition:** Exposure to lead, which inhibits enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Elevated Blood Lead Levels: > 5 μg/dL
    *   Elevated Zinc Protoporphyrin (ZPP) in Red Blood Cells: Indicates impaired heme synthesis
    *   Decreased Hemoglobin: Anemia
*   **Disease State Correlation**
*   Lead inhibits ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase, disrupting heme synthesis and causing neurological and developmental problems

## **Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Anemia associated with chronic inflammatory conditions
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Decreased Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Indicators of anemia

    *   Normal or Increased Ferritin: > 20 ng/mL (women), > 20 ng/mL (men)
*   **Disease State Correlation**
