# Precautions {-}

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   **Fasting:** Some hormone tests require patients to fast for a specified period (e.g., 8-12 hours) before specimen collection
        *   **Rationale:** Fasting minimizes the effects of food intake on hormone levels
        *   **Examples:** Insulin, glucose, lipid profiles
    *   **Medications:** Certain medications can interfere with hormone tests
        *   **Rationale:** Medications can affect hormone synthesis, secretion, metabolism, or receptor binding
        *   **Examples**
            *   Oral contraceptives: Affect sex hormone levels
            *   Corticosteroids: Affect cortisol levels
            *   Thyroid medications: Affect thyroid hormone levels
        *   **Action:** The physician should advise the patient on whether to withhold medications prior to testing
    *   **Timing:** The timing of specimen collection is crucial for some hormone tests due to diurnal variations or pulsatile secretion
        *   **Rationale:** Hormone levels can fluctuate throughout the day
        *   **Examples**
            *   Cortisol: Highest in the morning, lowest at night
            *   ACTH: Highest in the morning, lowest at night
            *   Growth hormone: Secreted in pulses
        *   **Action:** Collect specimens at the specified time to ensure accurate results
    *   **Stress:** Stress can affect hormone levels
        *   **Rationale:** Stress increases the release of cortisol, catecholamines, and other hormones
        *   **Action:** Minimize patient stress during specimen collection
    *   **Menstrual Cycle:** For women, the phase of the menstrual cycle can affect sex hormone levels
        *   **Rationale:** Estrogen and progesterone levels vary throughout the menstrual cycle
        *   **Action:** Collect specimens at the specified phase of the menstrual cycle

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Collection Tubes**
    *   Use appropriate collection tubes for each hormone test
        *   **Rationale:** Different tubes contain different anticoagulants and additives that can affect hormone stability and assay performance
        *   **Examples**
            *   Serum separator tubes (SST): Commonly used for many hormone tests
            *   EDTA tubes: Used for ACTH, renin
            *   Heparin tubes: Used for some peptide hormones
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for tube selection
*   **Order of Draw**
    *   Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents cross-contamination from tube additives
        *   **Action:** Consult the CLSI guidelines for the correct order of draw
*   **Technique**
    *   Use proper venipuncture technique
        *   **Rationale:** Minimizes hemolysis and contamination
        *   **Action:** Avoid prolonged tourniquet time and use a gentle technique
*   **Labeling**
    *   Label specimens immediately and accurately
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents misidentification and errors
        *   **Action:** Use two patient identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth)
*   **Volume**
    *   Collect the correct volume of blood
        *   **Rationale:** Insufficient volume can affect assay performance
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for minimum volume requirements

## **Specimen Processing** {-}

*   **Centrifugation**
    *   Centrifuge specimens promptly after collection
        *   **Rationale:** Separates serum or plasma from cells
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for centrifugation speed and time
*   **Separation**
    *   Separate serum or plasma from cells within the specified time frame
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents hemolysis and degradation of hormones
        *   **Action:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for separation time
*   **Aliquotting**
    *   Aliquot specimens into appropriate containers
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents contamination and allows for multiple tests
        *   **Action:** Use clean, dry containers
*   **Storage**
    *   Store specimens at the appropriate temperature
        *   **Rationale:** Preserves hormone stability
        *   **Examples**
            *   Refrigeration (2-8°C): For short-term storage
            *   Freezing (-20°C or -80°C): For long-term storage
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage conditions
*   **Thawing**
    *   Thaw specimens properly before testing
        *   **Rationale:** Prevents degradation of hormones
        *   **Action:** Thaw at room temperature or in a refrigerator, and mix gently
