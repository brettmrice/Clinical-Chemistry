# Action Mechanism {-}

Understanding how hormones work at the cellular level is key to understanding endocrinology. Hormones initiate their effects by binding to receptors, triggering a cascade of intracellular events

## **Hormone Receptors** {-}

*   **Definition:** Proteins located either on the cell surface or within the cell that bind to specific hormones, initiating a cellular response
*   **Types of Receptors**
    *   **Cell Surface Receptors:** Typically bind to peptide hormones and catecholamines
        *   **G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs):** Activate intracellular signaling pathways through G proteins
        *   **Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs):** Initiate phosphorylation cascades, leading to altered gene expression and cellular function
        *   **Cytokine Receptors:** Activate intracellular signaling pathways through Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)
    *   **Intracellular Receptors:** Located in the cytoplasm or nucleus, typically bind to steroid hormones and thyroid hormones
        *   **Nuclear Receptors:** Regulate gene transcription by binding to DNA response elements

## **Mechanisms of Hormone Action** {-}

*   **Peptide Hormones and Catecholamines**
    *   **Binding to Cell Surface Receptors:**
        *   Hormone binds to a specific receptor on the cell membrane
        *   Receptor undergoes a conformational change, activating intracellular signaling pathways
    *   **Activation of G Proteins:**
        *   GPCRs activate G proteins (Gs, Gi, Gq)
        *   Gs stimulates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP levels
        *   Gi inhibits adenylyl cyclase, decreasing cAMP levels
        *   Gq activates phospholipase C, increasing IP3 and DAG levels
    *   **Activation of Second Messengers:**
        *   cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates target proteins, altering their activity
        *   IP3 releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, activating protein kinase C (PKC) and other calcium-dependent signaling pathways
        *   DAG activates PKC, which phosphorylates target proteins
    *   **Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs):**
        *   Hormone binding causes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation
        *   Phosphorylated tyrosine residues recruit intracellular signaling proteins, such as SH2 domain-containing proteins
        *   Activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/Akt pathway
    *   **Signal Amplification:**
        *   The initial hormone-receptor interaction is amplified through signaling cascades, leading to a large cellular response
    *   **Cellular Response:**
        *   Changes in enzyme activity, gene expression, and cellular function

*   **Steroid Hormones and Thyroid Hormones**
    *   **Entry into the Cell:**
        *   Hormone diffuses across the cell membrane and enters the cytoplasm
    *   **Binding to Intracellular Receptors:**
        *   Hormone binds to a specific receptor in the cytoplasm or nucleus
        *   Receptor undergoes a conformational change, forming a hormone-receptor complex
    *   **Translocation to the Nucleus (if receptor is cytoplasmic):**
        *   Hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus
    *   **Binding to DNA:**
        *   Hormone-receptor complex binds to specific DNA response elements (HREs) in the promoter region of target genes
    *   **Regulation of Gene Transcription:**
        *   The hormone-receptor complex recruits coactivator or corepressor proteins, altering gene transcription
        *   Increased transcription leads to increased mRNA synthesis and protein production
        *   Decreased transcription leads to decreased mRNA synthesis and protein production
    *   **Cellular Response:**
        *   Changes in protein synthesis and cellular function

## **Detailed Mechanisms** {-}

*   **G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)**
    *   **Structure:**
        *   GPCRs are transmembrane proteins with seven transmembrane domains
        *   The extracellular domain binds to the hormone, while the intracellular domain interacts with G proteins
    *   **Activation:**
        *   Hormone binding causes a conformational change in the receptor, activating the associated G protein
        *   G proteins consist of three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma
        *   The alpha subunit binds to GTP and has intrinsic GTPase activity
        *   Activation of the G protein causes the alpha subunit to dissociate and activate or inhibit downstream effectors
    *   **Downstream Effectors:**
        *   Adenylyl cyclase: Stimulated by Gs, inhibited by Gi
            *   Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP
            *   cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA)
        *   Phospholipase C: Activated by Gq
            *   Phospholipase C catalyzes the hydrolysis of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG
            *   IP3 releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum
            *   DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC)
    *   **Termination of Signal:**
        *   The intrinsic GTPase activity of the G protein alpha subunit hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, inactivating the G protein
        *   Phosphodiesterases degrade cAMP, reducing PKA activity
        *   Calcium pumps remove calcium from the cytoplasm, reducing PKC activity

*   **Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)**
    *   **Structure:**
        *   RTKs are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain that binds to the hormone and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity
    *   **Activation:**
        *   Hormone binding causes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain
        *   Phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins with SH2 domains
    *   **Downstream Signaling Pathways:**
        *   MAPK/ERK Pathway:
            *   Activated by growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)
            *   Involves a cascade of protein kinases: Ras -> Raf -> MEK -> ERK
            *   ERK phosphorylates transcription factors, altering gene expression
        *   PI3K/Akt Pathway:
            *   Activated by insulin and growth factors
            *   Involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt
            *   Akt promotes cell survival, growth, and metabolism
    *   **Termination of Signal:**
        *   Protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups from tyrosine residues, inactivating the receptor
        *   GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras by promoting GTP hydrolysis

*   **Nuclear Receptors**
    *   **Structure:**
        *   Nuclear receptors are intracellular proteins with a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain
        *   The DNA-binding domain contains zinc finger motifs that recognize specific DNA sequences (response elements)
    *   **Activation:**
        *   Hormone enters the cell and binds to the receptor, causing a conformational change
        *   The hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus (if the receptor is cytoplasmic)
    *   **Regulation of Gene Transcription:**
        *   The hormone-receptor complex binds to specific DNA response elements (HREs) in the promoter region of target genes
        *   Recruitment of Coactivators:
            *   Coactivators are proteins that enhance gene transcription
            *   They include histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which modify chromatin structure to make DNA more accessible
        *   Recruitment of Corepressors:
            *   Corepressors are proteins that inhibit gene transcription
            *   They include histone deacetylases (HDACs), which modify chromatin structure to make DNA less accessible
    *   **Termination of Signal:**
        *   Hormone dissociates from the receptor, inactivating the complex
        *   Protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups from transcription factors
