# Precautions {-}

To ensure the reliability of TDM, it's essential to address pre-analytical and analytical factors, including special precautions, specimen handling, and interfering substances

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Identification**
    *   Accurate patient identification is essential to prevent errors
    *   Use two unique identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth)
*   **Timing of Specimen Collection**
    *   Collect specimens at the correct time relative to the drug administration schedule
        *   Trough levels: Collected immediately before the next dose
        *   Peak levels: Collected at a specific time after drug administration
    *   Record the date and time of drug administration and specimen collection
*   **Medication History**
    *   Obtain a complete medication history from the patient
    *   Document all prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as any herbal supplements
*   **Clinical Information**
    *   Gather relevant clinical information, such as the patient's age, weight, renal function, liver function, and concurrent medical conditions
*   **Chain of Custody**
    *   Maintain a clear chain of custody for all specimens
    *   Document the date, time, and initials of each person handling the specimen
*   **Informed Consent**
    *   Obtain informed consent from the patient before collecting specimens for TDM
*   **Safety Precautions**
    *   Follow standard safety precautions when handling blood and other biological specimens
    *   Wear gloves, gowns, and eye protection

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Specimen Type**
    *   Serum or plasma is commonly used for TDM
    *   Whole blood is used for some immunosuppressant drugs (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine)
*   **Collection Tubes**
    *   Use appropriate collection tubes for each drug
        *   Serum separator tubes (SST)
        *   EDTA tubes
        *   Heparin tubes
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for tube selection
*   **Order of Draw**
    *   Follow the correct order of draw to prevent cross-contamination
    *   Consult the CLSI guidelines for the correct order of draw
*   **Collection Technique**
    *   Use proper venipuncture technique to minimize hemolysis
    *   Avoid prolonged tourniquet time
*   **Specimen Volume**
    *   Collect sufficient volume to perform the assay and allow for repeat testing
    *   Follow the laboratory's guidelines for minimum volume requirements
*   **Labeling**
    *   Label specimens immediately and accurately with patient information, date, and time of collection

## **Specimen Processing** {-}

*   **Centrifugation**
    *   Centrifuge specimens promptly after collection
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for centrifugation speed and time
*   **Separation**
    *   Separate serum or plasma from cells within the specified time frame
    *   Prevent hemolysis
*   **Aliquotting**
    *   Aliquot specimens into appropriate containers
    *   Use clean, dry containers
*   **Storage**
    *   Store specimens at the appropriate temperature
        *   Refrigeration (2-8°C): For short-term storage
        *   Freezing (-20°C or -80°C): For long-term storage
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage conditions
*   **Thawing**
    *   Thaw specimens properly before testing
    *   Thaw at room temperature or in a refrigerator, and mix gently

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **High Drug Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Specimen collected at the wrong time, medication administration error, contamination
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, interfering substances, cross-reactivity
*   **Low Drug Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Specimen collected at the wrong time, improper storage, medication error, dilution
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, interfering substances, assay drift
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Patient variability, specimen handling errors, timing errors
    *   Analytical: Assay variability, interfering substances, cross-reactivity
*   **Quality Control Failures**
    *   Pre-analytical: QC material improperly stored, QC material expired
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, instrument malfunction
    *   Action: Investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Hemolysis**
    *   Interference: Releases intracellular components that can interfere with immunoassays
    *   Mitigation: Avoid hemolysis during collection and processing
*   **Lipemia**
    *   Interference: Turbidity from high lipid concentrations can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   Mitigation: Use lipemia clearing techniques or consider methods less affected by turbidity
*   **Bilirubin**
    *   Interference: High bilirubin levels can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   Mitigation: Use methods less susceptible to bilirubin interference
*   **Drugs**
    *   Interference: Other drugs can directly interfere with assays or affect drug levels
    *   Mitigation: Be aware of patient's medication list and potential drug interactions
*   **Heterophile Antibodies**
    *   Interference: Bind to assay antibodies, causing falsely high or low results
    *   Mitigation: Use blocking reagents or heterophile antibody blocking tubes
*   **Cross-Reactivity**
    *   Interference: Assay antibodies may cross-react with structurally similar compounds
    *   Mitigation: Use highly specific antibodies and be aware of potential cross-reactants
*   **Matrix Effects**
    *   Interference: Components in the sample matrix can affect the assay results
    *   Mitigation: Use matrix-matched calibrators and quality control materials
*   **Endogenous Substances**
    *   Interference: Digoxin-like immunoreactive substances (DLIS) can interfere with digoxin assays
    *   Mitigation: Use methods less susceptible to DLIS interference

## **Factors Specific to Different Drug Classes** {-}

*   **Aminoglycosides**
    *   Renal function: Monitor serum creatinine and creatinine clearance
    *   Interfering antibiotics: Certain penicillins can inactivate aminoglycosides in vitro
*   **Cardioactive Drugs**
    *   Electrolyte levels: Monitor potassium, magnesium, and calcium
    *   Cardiac function: Assess ECG for arrhythmias
    *   Digoxin-like immunoreactive substances (DLIS): Especially in neonates and patients with renal failure
*   **Anticonvulsants**
    *   Protein binding: Monitor free drug levels in patients with altered protein binding
    *   Drug interactions: Phenobarbital is a CYP enzyme inducer
*   **Antidepressants**
    *   CYP2D6 genotype: Consider genetic testing to predict drug metabolism
    *   Drug interactions: Many antidepressants are CYP enzyme inhibitors
*   **Immunosuppressants**
    *   Hematocrit levels: Use whole blood specimens and correct for hematocrit
    *   Calcineurin inhibitors: Monitor renal function and blood pressure
    *   Drug interactions: Many drugs can affect CYP3A4-mediated metabolism
