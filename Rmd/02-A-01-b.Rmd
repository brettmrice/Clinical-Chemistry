# Physiology {-}

Enzyme activity is crucial for maintaining cellular functions, and deviations from normal levels can indicate a range of diseases

## **Normal States** {-}

*   **Balanced Enzyme Activity:** Enzyme levels and activity are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis
*   **Cellular Compartmentalization:** Enzymes are localized to specific cellular compartments to ensure proper function

### **Balanced Enzyme Activity** {-}

*   Appropriate levels of enzymes are present in cells and body fluids to catalyze biochemical reactions efficiently
*   Enzyme activity is regulated by substrate concentration, pH, temperature, inhibitors, and activators
*   Enzyme synthesis and degradation are balanced to maintain a constant enzyme concentration
*   Enzymes are localized to specific cellular compartments to ensure proper function

### **Cellular Compartmentalization** {-}

*   Enzymes involved in specific metabolic pathways are localized to specific cellular compartments (e.g., mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol)
*   Compartmentalization ensures that reactions occur efficiently and in a coordinated manner
*   Compartmentalization also prevents enzymes from interfering with other cellular processes
*   Examples:
    *   Enzymes of glycolysis are located in the cytosol
    *   Enzymes of the Krebs cycle are located in the mitochondria
    *   Enzymes of fatty acid synthesis are located in the cytosol
    *   Enzymes of the electron transport chain are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane

## **Abnormal States** {-}

*   **Enzyme Deficiencies:** Genetic defects leading to reduced or absent enzyme activity
*   **Enzyme Elevations:** Increased enzyme levels in blood due to tissue damage or disease
*   **Isoenzyme Variations:** Abnormal distribution of isoenzymes
*   **Enzyme Inhibitions:** Inhibition of enzyme activity by drugs, toxins, or metabolic disorders

### **Enzyme Deficiencies** {-}

*   **Definition:** Genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding enzymes, leading to reduced or absent enzyme activity
*   **Pathophysiology:** Enzyme deficiencies disrupt metabolic pathways, leading to the accumulation of substrates and/or the deficiency of products
*   **Laboratory Findings:** Reduced or absent enzyme activity in affected tissues
*   **Symptoms:** Varies depending on the specific enzyme deficiency and the metabolic pathway affected
*   **Examples**
    *   Phenylketonuria (PKU): Deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)
        *   Elevated phenylalanine levels in blood
        *   Intellectual disability, seizures

        *   Elevated uric acid levels in blood and urine
        *   Neurological dysfunction, self-mutilation
    *   Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID): Deficiency in adenosine deaminase (ADA)
        *   Accumulation of deoxyadenosine in lymphocytes
        *   Impaired immune function, increased susceptibility to infections

### **Enzyme Elevations** {-}

*   **Definition:** Increased enzyme levels in blood, indicating tissue damage or disease
*   **Pathophysiology:** Tissue damage or disease causes the release of enzymes from cells into the bloodstream
*   **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated enzyme levels in blood
*   **Symptoms:** Varies depending on the specific enzyme and the tissue affected
*   **Examples**
    *   Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack): Elevated troponin, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB
        *   Chest pain, shortness of breath
    *   Hepatitis: Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
        *   Fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain
    *   Pancreatitis: Elevated amylase and lipase
        *   Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
    *   Prostate Cancer: Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
        *   Urinary symptoms, bone pain
    *   Muscular Dystrophy: Elevated creatine kinase (CK)
        *   Muscle weakness, muscle wasting

### **Isoenzyme Variations** {-}

*   **Definition:** Abnormal distribution of isoenzymes, indicating tissue-specific damage or disease
*   **Pathophysiology:** Different tissues express different isoenzymes of certain enzymes. Measuring the levels of these isoenzymes can help identify the source of tissue damage
*   **Laboratory Findings:** Altered ratios of isoenzymes
*   **Symptoms:** Varies depending on the specific isoenzyme and the tissue affected
*   **Examples**
    *   Creatine Kinase (CK) Isoenzymes:
        *   CK-MM: Found primarily in skeletal muscle
        *   CK-MB: Found primarily in heart muscle
        *   CK-BB: Found primarily in brain and smooth muscle
        *   Elevated CK-MB suggests myocardial damage
