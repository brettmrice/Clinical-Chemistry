Blood gas analysis is a critical tool for assessing a patient's respiratory and metabolic status

*   Underlying biochemical principles
*   Proper testing techniques
*   Accurate interpretation of results

## **Biochemical Theory and Pathways** {-}

*   **Fundamentals**
    *   Acids donate $H^+$, bases accept $H^+$
    *   pH: A measure of acidity/alkalinity
    *   Buffers: Resist pH changes
*   **Key Players**
    *   The relationship of $pH$, $HCO_3^-$, and Pa$CO_2$ in the bicarbonate buffer system (Henderson-Hasselbalch equation)
    *   $O_2$ and $CO_2$: Transport mechanisms and influencers
    *   Acid-Base Control
        *   Lungs and ventilation (fast response)
        *   Kidneys, $HCO_3^-$ regulation (slow response)
        *   Understanding the concepts of respiratory and metabolic balance will help to understand the disease state
*   **Understanding Arterial Blood Gasses (ABGs) requires understanding of the underlying physiology**
    *   Understanding acid production and elimination
    *   Understanding acid-base balance within the body

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Measurements**
    *   $pH$: Potentiometry with glass electrode
    *   Pa$O_2$: Amperometry with Clark electrode
    *   Pa$CO_2$: Potentiometry with Severinghaus electrode
*   **Calculations**
    *   $HCO_3^-$ is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
    *   Base Excess (BE) and Anion Gap (AG) are also calculated
*   **Considerations**
    *   Sample handling: anaerobic with prompt processing
    *   Quality Control: Calibrate instruments correctly
    *   Troubleshooting and interfering substances

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Normal Values to Know**
    *   pH: 7.35-7.45
    *   Pa$CO_2$: 35-45 mmHg
    *   $HCO_3^-$: 22-26 mEq/L
    *   Pa$O_2$: 80-100 mmHg
    *   Sa$O_2$: 95-100%
    *   Base Excess: -2 to +2 mEq/L
*   **Steps to interpretation**
    *   Is pH normal, acidemic, or alkalemic?
    *   Match primary disorder by abnormal levels of Pa$CO_2$ or $HCO_3^-$
    *   Is there compensation? Are these values appropriate
    *   What is the Pa$O_2$/Sa$O_2$?
*   **Important Formulas**
    *   Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
        *   $pH = pKa + \log \left( \frac {[A^-]} {[HA]} \right)$
        *   $pH = 6.1 + \log \left( {\frac {[HCO_3^-]} {0.03 \times pCO_2}} \right)$
    *   Anion Gap Calculation
        *   [$Na^+$] + [$K^+$] - [$Cl^-$] - [$HCO_3^-$]

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Respiratory Acidosis**
    *   pH < 7.35, Pa$CO_2$ > 45
    *   Causes: COPD, drug overdose
*   **Respiratory Alkalosis**
    *   pH > 7.45, Pa$CO_2$ < 35
    *   Causes: Anxiety, hypoxia
*   **Metabolic Acidosis**
    *   pH < 7.35, $HCO_3^-$ < 22
    *   Causes: DKA, renal failure
*   **Metabolic Alkalosis**
    *   pH > 7.45, $HCO_3^-$ > 26
    *   Causes: Vomiting, diuretic use
*   **Additional Clinical Considerations**
    *   Use Anion Gap calculation to distinguish causes of metabolic acidosis
    *   Consider Hypoxemia

## **In Summary** {-}

*   ABGs require an understanding of basic chemistry, as well as an understanding of the clinical implications for each result
*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to further identify any potential disturbance with the values that were collected
*   The kidneys, lungs, and chemical buffers all work together to maintain homeostasis in the body
