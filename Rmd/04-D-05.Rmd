# Disease Correlation {-}

Understanding how various disease states influence toxicological findings is critical for accurate interpretation and effective patient management

## **General Principles of Disease State Correlation in Toxicology** {-}

*   **Impact on Toxicokinetics:** Disease states can alter drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), leading to changes in toxic substance concentrations
*   **Individual Variability:** Disease states can introduce significant variability in how individuals respond to toxic substances
*   **Pre-Existing Conditions:** Pre-existing conditions can increase susceptibility to toxicity
*   **Clinical Context:** Always interpret toxicological results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and medical history
*   **Diagnostic Considerations:** Knowledge of common associations helps guide diagnostic evaluation
*   **Management Strategies:** Disease-specific considerations influence treatment decisions
