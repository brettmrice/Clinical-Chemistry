# Result Interpretation {-}

Interpreting therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) results requires a comprehensive approach that considers the patient's clinical status, dosing history, and potential influencing factors

## **General Principles of Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Reference Ranges**
    *   Use appropriate therapeutic ranges for the specific drug and patient population
    *   Be aware that therapeutic ranges are guidelines and may need to be individualized
*   **Clinical Context**
    *   Interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and other laboratory data
    *   Consider the patient's symptoms, medications, coexisting medical conditions, and response to therapy
*   **Dosing History**
    *   Review the patient's dosing history, including the dose, route of administration, and timing of doses
    *   Check for adherence to the prescribed regimen
*   **Sample Timing**
    *   Ensure that the specimen was collected at the appropriate time relative to the drug administration schedule (trough, peak, or random)
*   **Drug Interactions**
    *   Be aware of potential drug interactions that can affect drug concentrations
    *   Check for enzyme inducers, enzyme inhibitors, and other drugs that can alter absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion
*   **Analytical Considerations**
    *   Understand the limitations of the specific assay used, including its sensitivity, specificity, and potential for cross-reactivity
    *   Consider repeating the test using a different method if interference is suspected
*   **Steady-State Concentrations**
    *   Ensure that the patient has reached steady-state concentrations before interpreting drug levels
    *   Steady state is typically achieved after 5-7 half-lives
*   **Patient-Specific Factors**
    *   Consider factors such as age, weight, renal function, liver function, and genetics that can affect drug pharmacokinetics
    *   Adjust the therapeutic range based on these factors

## **Key Concepts in TDM Interpretation** {-}

*   **Therapeutic Range**
    *   The range of drug concentrations associated with optimal therapeutic effect and minimal toxicity
    *   Varies depending on the drug, the indication, and the individual patient
*   **Trough Level**
    *   The lowest drug concentration, typically measured immediately before the next dose
    *   Used to assess adequate drug exposure and minimize toxicity
*   **Peak Level**
    *   The highest drug concentration, typically measured at a specific time after drug administration
    *   Used to assess drug efficacy and avoid excessive concentrations
*   **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
    *   A measure of the total drug exposure over a specific time interval
    *   Provides a more comprehensive assessment of drug exposure than single-point measurements
*   **Volume of Distribution (Vd)**
    *   A measure of the apparent space in the body available to contain the drug
    *   Influences the peak concentration after a dose
*   **Clearance (CL)**
    *   A measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating a drug
    *   Influences the steady-state concentration
*   **Half-Life (t1/2)**
    *   The time it takes for the concentration of a drug in the body to be reduced by one-half
    *   Determines the time to reach steady-state and the dosing interval

## **General Interpretation Guidelines** {-}

*   **Levels Below Therapeutic Range**
    *   Consider increasing the dose or decreasing the dosing interval
    *   Assess patient adherence and drug interactions
    *   Consider using a loading dose to achieve therapeutic concentrations more rapidly
*   **Levels Within Therapeutic Range**
    *   Continue current therapy and monitor for efficacy and toxicity
    *   Assess patient adherence and drug interactions
    *   May need to adjust the dose based on clinical response
*   **Levels Above Therapeutic Range**
    *   Consider reducing the dose or increasing the dosing interval
    *   Assess for drug interactions and renal/hepatic impairment
    *   Monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity
    *   In some cases, temporary discontinuation of the drug may be necessary
*   **Unexpected Results**
    *   Repeat the test to confirm the result
    *   Check for analytical errors or interferences
    *   Review the patient's medical history and medication list
    *   Consider alternative analytical methods

## **Specific Considerations for Different Drug Classes** {-}

### **Aminoglycosides (e.g., Gentamicin)** {-}

*   **Target Concentrations**
    *   Trough: < 1-2 μg/mL
    *   Peak: 5-10 μg/mL (depending on the infection)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Elevated trough levels: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity
    *   Low peak levels: May indicate inadequate dosing or resistance
    *   Adjust dosing interval based on trough levels and renal function
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Renal function: Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance
    *   Infection severity: Higher peak levels may be needed for serious infections
    *   Concurrent nephrotoxic medications: Avoid use if possible

### **Cardioactive Drugs (e.g., Digoxin)** {-}

*   **Target Concentrations**
    *   0.5-2.0 ng/mL (heart failure)
    *   0.8-1.2 ng/mL (atrial fibrillation)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Elevated levels: Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances
    *   Low levels: May indicate inadequate control of heart failure or atrial fibrillation
    *   Assess potassium levels: Hypokalemia increases digoxin toxicity
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Renal function: Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance
    *   Electrolyte imbalances: Correct potassium and magnesium deficiencies
    *   Drug interactions: Quinidine, amiodarone, and verapamil can increase digoxin levels

### **Anticonvulsants (e.g., Phenobarbital)** {-}

*   **Target Concentrations**
    *   15-40 μg/mL (seizure control)
