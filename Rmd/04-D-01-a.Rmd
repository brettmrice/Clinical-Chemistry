# Toxic Effects {-}

Understanding the relationship between toxicokinetics and toxic effects, signs, and symptoms is crucial for effective clinical toxicology. Toxicokinetics describes how a substance moves through the body, while understanding the clinical manifestations of toxicity aids in diagnosis and treatment

## **Toxicokinetics: What the Body Does to the Toxin** {-}

*   **Definition:** The study of the movement of toxic substances within the body, encompassing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)
*   **Relationship to Pharmacokinetics:** Toxicokinetics is essentially the study of pharmacokinetics applied to toxic substances, providing insights into how the body handles these compounds

### **Absorption** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which a toxic substance enters the body
*   **Routes of Exposure**
    *   Ingestion: Oral intake of a toxic substance
    *   Inhalation: Breathing in toxic gases, vapors, or particulate matter
    *   Dermal Absorption: Absorption through the skin
    *   Injection: Introduction directly into the bloodstream or tissues
    *   Mucosal Absorption: Absorption through mucous membranes (e.g., nasal, oral, rectal)
*   **Factors Affecting Absorption**
    *   **Route of Exposure:** Intravenous (IV) exposure has 100% bioavailability
    *   **Physicochemical Properties**
        *   Molecular weight, lipophilicity, and ionization affect the ease with which a substance crosses biological membranes
    *   **Concentration:** Higher concentrations increase absorption rates
    *   **Surface Area:** Larger surface areas (e.g., lungs, small intestine) enhance absorption
    *   **Blood Flow:** Increased blood flow at the absorption site increases absorption rates
    *   **Physiological Factors:** Gastric emptying time, intestinal motility, and skin integrity influence absorption rates

### **Distribution** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which a toxic substance is transported from the bloodstream to various tissues and organs in the body
*   **Factors Affecting Distribution**
    *   **Blood Flow:** Highly perfused organs (brain, heart, liver, kidneys) receive the toxic substance more rapidly
    *   **Tissue Permeability**
        *   Lipid-soluble substances can easily cross cell membranes
        *   Water-soluble substances may require transport proteins
    *   **Protein Binding:** Binding of toxic substances to plasma proteins (albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein)
        *   Only unbound (free) substance can exert toxic effects
        *   Substances with high protein binding have limited distribution
    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** A measure of the apparent space in the body available to contain the toxic substance
        *   Vd = Amount of Substance in the Body / Plasma Concentration
        *   High Vd: Indicates extensive tissue distribution
        *   Low Vd: Indicates limited tissue distribution
    *   **Tissue Binding:** Accumulation of toxic substances in specific tissues (e.g., lead in bone, DDT in adipose tissue)
*   **Barriers to Distribution**
    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB):** Protects the brain from many toxic substances
    *   **Placental Barrier:** Protects the fetus from some, but not all, toxic substances

### **Metabolism** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body chemically alters a toxic substance, often to facilitate its elimination
*   **Primary Site:** Liver
*   **Other Sites:** Kidneys, intestines, lungs, and plasma
*   **Phases of Metabolism**
    *   **Phase I Reactions:** Introduce or expose a functional group on the toxic substance molecule
        *   Oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis
        *   Enzymes: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs)
    *   **Phase II Reactions:** Conjugate a polar molecule to the toxic substance molecule
        *   Glucuronidation, sulfation, acetylation, glutathione conjugation
        *   Enzymes: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs)
*   **Activation vs. Detoxification**
    *   **Detoxification:** Metabolism can convert toxic substances into less harmful metabolites
    *   **Activation:** Metabolism can convert relatively harmless substances into more toxic metabolites (bioactivation)
*   **Factors Affecting Metabolism**
    *   **Genetic Factors:** Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect the rate of metabolism
    *   **Age:** Infants and elderly individuals may have reduced metabolic capacity
    *   **Disease States:** Liver disease can impair metabolism
    *   **Drug Interactions:** Enzyme inducers and inhibitors can affect the metabolism of other substances

### **Excretion** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body eliminates a toxic substance or its metabolites
*   **Primary Routes**
    *   **Kidneys:** Most toxic substances are excreted in the urine
        *   Glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, tubular reabsorption
    *   **Liver:** Some toxic substances are excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces
*   **Other Routes:** Lungs, sweat, saliva, breast milk
*   **Factors Affecting Excretion**
    *   **Renal Function:** Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption affect renal excretion
    *   **Liver Function:** Bile flow and hepatic metabolism affect biliary excretion
    *   **Substance Properties:** Molecular size, ionization, and protein binding affect excretion
    *   **Urine pH:** Can affect the excretion of weak acids and bases
*   **Clearance (CL):** A measure of the body's ability to eliminate a toxic substance
    *   CL = Rate of Elimination / Plasma Concentration

## **Toxic Effects, Signs, and Symptoms: What the Toxin Does to the Body** {-}

*   **Dose-Response Relationship:** The severity of toxic effects is generally related to the dose of the toxic substance
*   **Target Organs:** Toxic substances can selectively target specific organs or tissues (e.g., liver, kidneys, brain)
*   **Mechanisms of Toxicity:** Toxic substances can cause damage through various mechanisms, including:
    *   Cellular Necrosis: Cell death
    *   Apoptosis: Programmed cell death
