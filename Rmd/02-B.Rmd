# Proteins {-}

This section is designed to help you understand the role of proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds in health and disease. Topics covered will be biochemical theory, lab testing, result interpretation, and the disease-specific implications

## **Biochemical Theory and Physiology** {-}

*   **Protein Building Blocks:** Made of amino acids, proteins perform diverse cellular functions
*   **Protein Synthesis:** Transcription and translation guided by genetic code
*   **Protein Degradation:** Breakdown of proteins into amino acids via lysosomes and proteasomes
*   **Amino Acid Metabolism:** Transamination, deamination, and use in other compounds
*   **Nitrogen Balance:** Intake vs. excretion, reflecting protein synthesis/breakdown
*   **Key Compounds**
    *   Proteins
    *   Amino Acids
    *   Urea
    *   Uric Acid
    *   Creatinine
    *   Ammonia

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Protein Tests**
    *   Total Protein: Biuret method
    *   Albumin: Dye-binding methods (BCG or BCP)
    *   Prealbumin: Immunoassay
*   **Nitrogen Waste Product Tests**
    *   Urea (BUN): Enzymatic methods
    *   Creatinine: Jaffe reaction or enzymatic assays
    *   Uric Acid: Uricase method
    *   Ammonia: Enzymatic or ISE methods
*   **Specialized Protein Tests**
    *   Protein Electrophoresis: Separates proteins by charge/size
    *   Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE): Identifies monoclonal proteins
    *   Tumor Markers: Measured by immunoassay
    *   Cardiac Markers: Measured by immunoassay

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **General Markers**
    *   High levels of proteins indicate high protein level
    *   Low levels of protein indicate low protein level
*   **Kidney Function Tests**
    *   Elevated Urea and Creatinine indicate decreased kidney function
*   **Protein Electrophoresis:** Interpret relative protein band intensity compared to others to find abnormal distributions, with special note of monoclonal gammopathy in the gamma globulin region
*   **Malignancy markers indicate increased cancer risk**
*   **Patient specific medical history**

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Liver Disease:** Decreased albumin, increased bilirubin and ammonia
*   **Kidney Disease:** Elevated creatinine and urea, proteinuria
*   **Malnutrition:** Decreased albumin and prealbumin
*   **Multiple Myeloma:** Monoclonal protein on electrophoresis
*   **Heart Failure:** Elevated BNP
*   **Cancer:** Elevated tumor markers
