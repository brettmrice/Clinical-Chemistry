# Vitamins, Nutrition {-}

This section covers vitamins and nutrition in special chemistry - biochemical theory, lab procedures, result interpretation, and disease correlations

## **Biochemical Theory and Pathways** {-}

*   **Vitamins as Essential Nutrients**
    *   Organic compounds needed in small amounts for metabolic processes; the body cannot synthesize them adequately
    *   Classified as water-soluble (B vitamins, C) and fat-soluble (A, D, E, K)
*   **General Functions**
    *   Act as coenzymes (assist enzymes), antioxidants (protect against damage), or regulators (influence gene expression)
*   **Specific Roles**
    *   B vitamins: Involved in energy metabolism
    *   Vitamin C: Antioxidant, collagen synthesis
    *   Vitamin A: Vision, cell differentiation
    *   Vitamin D: Calcium and phosphate regulation
    *   Vitamin E: Antioxidant
    *   Vitamin K: Blood clotting
*   **Metabolic Pathways**
    *   Absorption: Occurs in the small intestine
    *   Transport: Via bloodstream, either freely or bound to proteins
    *   Storage: Fat-soluble vitamins stored in the liver/adipose tissue
    *   Excretion: Water-soluble vitamins excreted in urine

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Analytical Principles**
    *   Spectrophotometry: Measures light absorbance
    *   Fluorometry: Measures fluorescence
    *   Immunoassays: Uses antibody-antigen interactions (e.g., ELISA)
    *   Chromatography: Separates compounds (e.g., HPLC, GC)
    *   Mass Spectrometry: Measures mass-to-charge ratio (LC-MS)
    *   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry: Measures light absorption by free atoms
*   **Pre-analytical Considerations**
    *   Patient Preparation: Fasting, medication/supplement restrictions
    *   Specimen Collection: Proper tubes, order of draw, technique
    *   Specimen Processing: Timely centrifugation, separation, storage
*   **Quality Control**
    *   Run QC samples to ensure accuracy and precision
    *   Calibrate instruments regularly

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Use appropriate reference ranges based on age, sex, population
*   **Clinical Context**
    *   Interpret results with patient history, symptoms, and other lab data
*   **Interpreting Vitamin Levels**
    *   Evaluate whether the vitamin is high, low, or within range
    *   Consider test limitations: Assay specificity, interfering substances
*   **Influencing Factors**
    *   Medications, diet, malabsorption, lifestyle

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Deficiency Disorders**
    *   Vitamin B1 (Thiamin): Beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
    *   Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Ariboflavinosis
    *   Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Pellagra
    *   Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Neurological symptoms, dermatitis
    *   Vitamin B9 (Folate): Megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects
    *   Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): Megaloblastic anemia, neurological problems
    *   Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid): Scurvy
    *   Vitamin A: Night blindness, xerophthalmia, immune dysfunction
    *   Vitamin D: Rickets/osteomalacia
    *   Vitamin E: Neurological symptoms, hemolytic anemia
    *   Vitamin K: Bleeding disorders
*   **Toxicities**
    *   Vitamin A: Liver damage, birth defects
    *   Vitamin D: Hypercalcemia, kidney stones
    *   Vitamin E: Increased bleeding risk
    *   Niacin: Flushing, liver damage
*   **Other Disease Correlations**
    *   Chronic diseases: CV disease, cancer, diabetes
    *   Malabsorption syndromes: Affect vitamin/mineral absorption
*   **Key Biochemical Tests**
    *   Vitamin levels (serum or plasma)
    *   Red blood cell folate
    *   Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (B12 status)
    *   25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vitamin D status)
    *   Prothrombin time (Vitamin K status)

*   **Malnutrition:** Imbalance from inadequate/excessive intake
*   **Deficiency:** Inadequate nutrient levels
*   **Toxicity:** Excessive nutrient levels
*   **Reference Interval:** Normal range for lab test
*   **Pre-analytical:** Processes before analysis
