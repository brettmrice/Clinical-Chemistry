# Metabolism, Excretion {-}

Understanding drug metabolism and excretion processes is critical in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

## **Drug Metabolism** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body chemically alters a drug, often to facilitate its elimination
*   **Primary Site of Metabolism:** Liver
*   **Other Sites:** Kidneys, intestines, lungs, and plasma
*   **Purpose of Metabolism**
    *   Convert lipid-soluble drugs into more water-soluble metabolites, facilitating their excretion in the urine
    *   Inactivate drugs to terminate their pharmacological effects
    *   Activate prodrugs into active metabolites
*   **Phases of Metabolism**
    *   Phase I Reactions: Introduce or expose a functional group on the drug molecule through oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis
    *   Phase II Reactions: Conjugate a polar molecule to the drug molecule, such as glucuronic acid, sulfate, or glutathione

### **Phase I Metabolism** {-}

*   **Oxidation**
    *   Addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen atoms from the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes
    *   Examples of reactions: Hydroxylation, epoxidation, N-oxidation, S-oxidation
*   **Reduction**
    *   Addition of hydrogen atoms or electrons to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Reductases
    *   Examples of reactions: Reduction of nitro groups, azo groups, and carbonyl groups
*   **Hydrolysis**
    *   Addition of water to break a chemical bond
    *   Enzymes involved: Esterases, amidases, peptidases
    *   Examples of reactions: Hydrolysis of esters, amides, and peptides

### **Phase II Metabolism** {-}

*   **Glucuronidation**
    *   Addition of glucuronic acid to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)
    *   Results in highly water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted in the urine
*   **Sulfation**
    *   Addition of a sulfate group to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Sulfotransferases (SULTs)
    *   Results in water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted in the urine
*   **Acetylation**
    *   Addition of an acetyl group to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: N-acetyltransferases (NATs)
    *   Genetic polymorphisms in NAT enzymes can affect drug metabolism
*   **Glutathione Conjugation**
    *   Addition of glutathione to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)
    *   Important for detoxifying reactive metabolites
*   **Methylation**
    *   Addition of a methyl group to the drug molecule
    *   Enzymes involved: Methyltransferases
    *   Can either activate or inactivate drugs

### **Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes** {-}

*   **Definition:** A superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze the oxidation of many drugs and endogenous compounds
*   **Location:** Primarily in the liver, but also present in other tissues
*   **Importance in Drug Metabolism:** Responsible for the metabolism of approximately 75% of clinically used drugs
*   **Key CYP Enzymes**
    *   CYP3A4: Metabolizes the largest number of drugs
    *   CYP2D6: Metabolizes many psychiatric and cardiovascular drugs
    *   CYP2C9: Metabolizes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warfarin
    *   CYP2C19: Metabolizes proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and clopidogrel
    *   CYP1A2: Metabolizes caffeine and theophylline

### **Factors Affecting Drug Metabolism** {-}

*   **Genetic Factors**
    *   Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect drug metabolism
    *   Individuals can be classified as poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, or ultra-rapid metabolizers
*   **Age**
    *   Infants have immature metabolic enzyme systems
    *   Elderly individuals may have decreased liver function and reduced enzyme activity
*   **Disease States**
    *   Liver disease: Reduces metabolic enzyme activity
    *   Kidney disease: Affects drug clearance and can lead to drug accumulation
    *   Heart failure: Reduces blood flow to the liver and kidneys, impairing drug metabolism and excretion
*   **Drug Interactions**
    *   Enzyme Inducers: Increase the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to decreased drug levels
    *   Enzyme Inhibitors: Decrease the activity of metabolizing enzymes, leading to increased drug levels
*   **Diet and Environmental Factors**
    *   Grapefruit juice: Inhibits CYP3A4
    *   Smoking: Induces CYP1A2
    *   Alcohol: Can induce or inhibit certain enzymes
*   **Gender**
    *   Differences in hormone levels and body composition can affect drug metabolism

## **Drug Excretion** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process by which the body eliminates a drug or its metabolites
*   **Primary Routes of Excretion**
    *   Kidneys: Most drugs are excreted in the urine
    *   Liver: Some drugs are excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces
*   **Other Routes:** Lungs, sweat, saliva, breast milk
*   **Renal Excretion**
    *   Glomerular Filtration: Drugs and small molecules are filtered from the blood into the renal tubules
        *   Only unbound (free) drug can be filtered
    *   Tubular Secretion: Active transport of drugs from the blood into the renal tubules
        *   Can be affected by drug interactions
    *   Tubular Reabsorption: Passive or active transport of drugs from the renal tubules back into the blood
        *   Lipid-soluble drugs are more readily reabsorbed
        *   Urine pH can affect the reabsorption of weak acids and bases
*   **Biliary Excretion**
    *   Drugs and metabolites are transported from the liver into the bile
    *   Bile is secreted into the small intestine and eliminated in the feces
    *   Some drugs undergo enterohepatic circulation, where they are reabsorbed from the intestine back into the blood
*   **Clearance (CL)**
    *   A measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating a drug from the body
    *   Total Clearance: Sum of all clearance pathways (renal, hepatic, and other)
    *   Renal Clearance: The volume of plasma from which a drug is completely removed by the kidneys per unit of time
    *   Hepatic Clearance: The volume of plasma from which a drug is completely removed by the liver per unit of time
*   **Factors Affecting Excretion**
    *   Renal Function: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption affect renal drug excretion
    *   Liver Function: Bile flow and hepatic metabolism affect biliary drug excretion
    *   Drug Properties: Molecular size, ionization, and protein binding affect excretion
    *   Drug Interactions: Some drugs can affect the excretion of other drugs

## **Clinical Significance** {-}

*   **Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs)**
    *   Knowledge of metabolic pathways and drug excretion mechanisms is crucial for predicting and managing DDIs
    *   Enzyme inducers and inhibitors can significantly alter drug levels, leading to therapeutic failure or toxicity
*   **Pharmacogenomics**
    *   Genetic testing can identify individuals with variations in drug-metabolizing enzymes
    *   Personalized dosing recommendations can be made based on an individual's genotype
*   **Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment**
    *   Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function may require lower doses or less frequent dosing to avoid drug accumulation and toxicity
*   **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)**
    *   TDM is used to optimize drug therapy by monitoring drug concentrations and adjusting doses based on individual patient factors
    *   TDM can help ensure that drug levels are within the therapeutic range and minimize the risk of toxicity
