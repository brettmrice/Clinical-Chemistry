# Toxicology {-}

This section covers the key components of toxicology

## **Biochemical Theory and Pathways** {-}

*   **Toxicokinetics:** How the body handles toxins (ADME processes)
    *   Absorption: Entry into the body
    *   Distribution: Transport to tissues
    *   Metabolism: Chemical alteration (detoxification or bioactivation)
    *   Excretion: Elimination from the body
*   **Mechanisms of Toxicity**
    *   Cellular damage, enzyme inhibition, oxidative stress, etc
*   **Target Organs**
    *   Specific organs are more vulnerable to certain toxins
    *   Liver, kidneys, brain, lungs, heart
*   **Dose-Response Relationship**
    *   Higher doses generally cause more severe effects

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Analytical Principles**
    *   Immunoassays: Antibody-antigen binding for screening
    *   Chromatography: Separates compounds
    *   Mass Spectrometry: Identifies compounds by mass
    *   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry: Measures light absorption by atoms
*   **Common Assays**
    *   Drugs of abuse screens
    *   Alcohol levels
    *   Heavy metal analysis
    *   Specific drug assays
*   **Special Precautions**
    *   Chain of custody, proper storage, quality control

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Results**
    *   Qualitative: Positive/negative
    *   Quantitative: Numerical concentration
*   **Cutoff Values**
    *   Threshold for positive results
*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Limited in toxicology (therapeutic ranges for some drugs)
*   **Analytical Considerations**
    *   Cross-reactivity, interfering substances
*   **Clinical Correlation**
    *   Patient history, symptoms, medications

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Liver Disease:** Impairs metabolism
*   **Renal Disease:** Impairs excretion
*   **Heart Failure:** Alters distribution
*   **Pulmonary Disease:** Affects inhalation
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Increases susceptibility
*   **Genetic Factors:** Influence metabolism
