# Aminoglycosides {-}

Understanding the chemical and physical properties of aminoglycosides like gentamicin is essential for comprehending their pharmacokinetic behavior, mechanism of action, and analytical methods used in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

## **Chemical Properties of Aminoglycosides** {-}

*   **Definition:** Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics composed of amino-modified glycosides (sugars) linked by glycosidic bonds
*   **Structure:** Each aminoglycoside molecule consists of an aminocyclitol ring (usually 2-deoxystreptamine) connected to various amino sugars
*   **Functional Groups:** Multiple amino and hydroxyl groups, giving them strong basic properties
*   **Molecular Weight:** Typically ranges from 400 to 600 Da
*   **Chemical Stability:** Generally stable in aqueous solutions, but can be affected by pH and temperature

## **Physical Properties of Aminoglycosides** {-}

*   **Appearance:** White or off-white powders
*   **Solubility:** Highly water-soluble due to the presence of multiple polar amino and hydroxyl groups
*   **Partition Coefficient (Log P):** Low Log P values indicate poor lipid solubility
*   **Ionization:** Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, meaning they have multiple positive charges
*   **Hygroscopicity:** Some aminoglycosides are hygroscopic, meaning they readily absorb moisture from the air

## **Specific Chemical and Physical Properties of Gentamicin** {-}

*   **Structure:** Gentamicin is a mixture of closely related aminoglycoside antibiotics, primarily gentamicin C1, C1a, and C2
*   **Molecular Formula**
    *   Gentamicin C1: $C_{21}H_{43}N_5O_7$
    *   Gentamicin C1a: $C_{20}H_{41}N_5O_7$
    *   Gentamicin C2: $C_{20}H_{41}N_5O_6$
*   **Molecular Weight:** Approximately 477.60 g/mol for gentamicin C1
*   **Appearance:** White to off-white powder
*   **Solubility:** Highly soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether
*   **pKa Values:** Gentamicin has multiple pKa values due to the presence of several amino groups
*   **Partition Coefficient (Log P):** Low Log P value indicates poor lipid solubility

## **Pharmacokinetic Implications** {-}

*   **Absorption:** Poor oral absorption due to high polarity and charge
    *   Primarily administered intravenously or intramuscularly
*   **Distribution:** Limited distribution into tissues and body fluids
    *   Low volume of distribution (Vd)
    *   Does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier
*   **Protein Binding:** Low protein binding (less than 30%)
    *   Most of the drug exists in the free, active form in the plasma
*   **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism
    *   Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine
*   **Excretion:** Primarily eliminated by glomerular filtration in the kidneys
    *   Renal impairment significantly affects drug clearance

## **Mechanism of Action and Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR)** {-}

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Aminoglycosides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit
    *   This binding interferes with mRNA translation and causes misreading of the genetic code
*   **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR)**
    *   The presence of multiple amino groups is crucial for binding to the negatively charged ribosomal RNA
    *   The specific arrangement of amino sugars and the aminocyclitol ring determines the spectrum of activity and susceptibility to bacterial resistance mechanisms

## **Analytical Considerations in TDM** {-}

*   **Analytical Methods**
    *   **Immunoassays:** Commonly used for routine TDM due to their ease of use and high throughput
    *   **Chromatography:** HPLC with UV or fluorescence detection can be used to separate and quantify individual gentamicin components
    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** LC-MS/MS provides high sensitivity and specificity for gentamicin quantification
*   **Sample Preparation**
    *   Protein precipitation or solid-phase extraction (SPE) may be used to remove interfering substances from the sample
*   **Calibration and Quality Control**
    *   Use appropriate calibrators and quality control materials to ensure accurate and reliable results
*   **Interferences**
    *   Other antibiotics and drugs can interfere with aminoglycoside assays
    *   Hemolysis and lipemia can also affect assay performance
    *    Cross reactivity can occur between aminoglycosides within certain immunoassays

## **Clinical Significance in TDM** {-}

*   **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)**
    *   TDM is essential for optimizing aminoglycoside therapy and minimizing the risk of toxicity
    *   Aminoglycosides have a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that the therapeutic and toxic concentrations are close together
    *   TDM is used to monitor peak and trough concentrations:
        *   **Peak Concentrations:** Reflect the maximum drug level in the body and are associated with efficacy
        *   **Trough Concentrations:** Reflect the minimum drug level in the body and are associated with toxicity
*   **Dosage Adjustments**
    *   Dosage adjustments are based on TDM results and patient-specific factors, such as renal function and infection severity
*   **Monitoring for Toxicity**
    *   Assess renal function (serum creatinine, creatinine clearance)
    *   Monitor for ototoxicity (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo)
*   **Specific considerations**
    *   Aminoglycoside concentrations can be higher in patients with ascites
    *   High doses can be more effective to treat infection, but must balance the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity
