# Disease Correlation {-}

Enzyme testing is a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics. Connecting enzyme levels to specific diseases is crucial for accurate diagnoses and treatment

*   **Key Considerations:** Tissue Distribution, Kinetics, and Sensitivity/Specificity

*   **Clinical Significance:** Aid in differential diagnoses and disease stages

## **Cardiac Markers** {-}

*   **Creatine Kinase - MB (CK-MB)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum, peaks within 24 hours
    *   Disease State Correlation: Myocardial Infarction
        *   Elevated CK-MB confirms myocardial necrosis
    *   Clinical Significance: To support a diagnosis of myocardial infarction
    *   **Troponin (I or T):** A protein that is a more specific indicator of myocardial damage than CK-MB

## **Liver Function** {-}

*   **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Hepatitis
    *   Clinical Significance: High level can confirm that hepatitis is present
*   **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Liver Damage, Myocardial Infarction, Muscle Injury
    *   Clinical Significance: Used to assess liver damage
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Biliary Obstruction, Bone Disease
    *   Clinical Significance: Help determine liver damage vs bile duct restriction
*   **Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, Biliary Obstruction
    *   Clinical Significance: Help to confirm liver damage and bile duct restrictions, but moreso from alcohol

## **Pancreatic Function** {-}

*   **Amylase**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Pancreatitis
    *   Clinical Significance: Support a diagnosis of pancreatitis
*   **Lipase**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Pancreatitis
    *   Clinical Significance: Help diagnose pancreatitis - more specific to the pancreas

## **Muscle Damage** {-}

*   **Creatine Kinase (CK) - Total**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Rhabdomyolysis
    *   Clinical Significance: Confirm if muscles are damaged

## **Other Enzymes** {-}

*   **Acid Phosphatase**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Prostate Cancer
    *   Clinical Significance: To check for prostate cancer
*   **Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)**
    *   Laboratory Findings: Elevated in serum
    *   Disease State Correlation: Sarcoidosis
    *   Clinical Significance: Help support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis

## **Key Considerations** {-}

*   To confirm if the appropriate tissues are damaged
*   To rule out other causes for the elevated enzymes
*   To test for other isoenzymes or biomarkers that may correlate with the current lab results

## **Caveats** {-}

*   Enzymes can be elevated due to injury or damage to cells
*   Enzyme activity can be influenced by interfering substances
*   Normal range can vary
