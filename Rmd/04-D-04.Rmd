# Result Interpretation {-}

Interpreting toxicology test results is multifaceted. This section describes the steps to follow in order to properly interpret

## **General Principles of Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Results**
    *   Qualitative: Indicates the presence or absence of a substance (e.g., positive or negative)
    *   Quantitative: Provides a numerical value for the concentration of a substance
*   **Cutoff Values**
    *   The concentration above which a test is considered positive
    *   Cutoff values are established based on analytical sensitivity and clinical relevance
*   **Units of Measurement**
    *   Be familiar with the units of measurement used by the laboratory (e.g., ng/mL, μg/mL, mg/L)
*   **Reference Intervals**
    *   Toxicology tests typically do not have "normal" reference intervals, as the goal is to detect the presence of toxic substances
    *   However, therapeutic ranges may be available for some drugs
*   **Chain of Custody**
    *   Verify the chain of custody to ensure the integrity and validity of the specimen
*   **Positive and Negative Controls**
    *   Ensure that positive and negative controls are within acceptable limits
*   **Interfering Substances**
    *   Be aware of potential interfering substances that can affect test results

## **Factors Affecting Interpretation** {-}

*   **Patient History**
    *   Age, sex, weight, medical conditions, medications, and substance use history
*   **Time of Sample Collection**
    *   Time since ingestion, inhalation, or exposure
*   **Route of Exposure**
    *   Ingestion, inhalation, dermal, injection
*   **Metabolism and Elimination**
    *   Liver and kidney function
    *   Genetic factors affecting drug metabolism
*   **Drug Interactions**
    *   Concurrent use of other drugs
*   **Analytical Limitations**
    *   Cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity of the assay

## **Step-by-Step Approach to Result Interpretation** {-}

1.  **Verify Patient Information:** Confirm the patient's identity and demographic information
2.  **Review Analytical Data**
        *   Check QC results and calibration data
        *   Assess the validity of the results
3.  **Assess Qualitative Results**
        *   If positive, proceed to confirmation and quantitative analysis
        *   If negative, consider the possibility of a false-negative result due to low concentration, interfering substances, or limitations of the assay
4.  **Evaluate Quantitative Results**
        *   Compare the concentration to cutoff values and therapeutic ranges
        *   Consider the dose-response relationship
5.  **Correlate with Clinical Information**
        *   Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, and other laboratory data
6.  **Consider Interfering Factors**
        *   Assess potential drug interactions and interfering substances
7.  **Provide an Interpretation**
        *   Summarize the findings and provide a concise interpretation of the results
        *   Explain the clinical significance of the results
        *   Offer recommendations for further testing or management

## **Specific Considerations for Different Substance Classes** {-}

### **Alcohols** {-}

*   **Typical Analytes:** Ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol
*   **Reporting Units:** mg/dL, g/dL
*   **Cutoff Values:** Vary depending on the substance and the legal or clinical context
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Ethanol: Legal limits for driving under the influence (DUI)
    *   Methanol and ethylene glycol: Toxic metabolites can cause severe acidosis and organ damage
    *   Osmolal Gap: The difference between measured and calculated osmolality can suggest the presence of unmeasured alcohols
*   **Clinical Significance:** Intoxication, poisoning, differential diagnosis of altered mental status

### **Heavy Metals** {-}

*   **Typical Analytes:** Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium
*   **Reporting Units:** μg/dL, μg/L
*   **Cutoff Values:** Vary depending on the metal and the regulatory guidelines
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Lead: Elevated levels can cause neurological damage, developmental delays, and anemia
    *   Mercury: Different forms of mercury (elemental, inorganic, organic) have different toxicities
    *   Arsenic: Acute and chronic exposure can cause various health effects, including cancer
*   **Clinical Significance:** Environmental or occupational exposure, poisoning, chronic toxicity

### **Analgesics** {-}

*   **Typical Analytes:** Acetaminophen, salicylates, opioids, NSAIDs
*   **Reporting Units:** μg/mL, mg/L
*   **Cutoff Values:** Vary depending on the drug and the clinical context
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Acetaminophen: Risk of hepatotoxicity
    *   Salicylates: Risk of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
    *   Opioids: Respiratory depression, altered mental status
*   **Clinical Significance:** Overdose, toxicity, monitoring of therapeutic drug levels

### **Drugs of Abuse** {-}

*   **Typical Analytes:** Amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etc
*   **Reporting Units:** ng/mL, μg/mL
*   **Cutoff Values:** Vary depending on the drug and the testing purpose (e.g., forensic, workplace, clinical)
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Metabolic pathways: Different metabolites may be detected depending on the assay
    *   Cross-reactivity: Some assays may cross-react with structurally similar compounds
*   **Clinical Significance:** Drug abuse, overdose, monitoring of drug treatment programs

### **Cardioactive Drugs (e.g., Digoxin)** {-}

*   **Typical Analytes:** Digoxin
*   **Reporting Units:** ng/mL
*   **Therapeutic Range:**  0.5 - 2.0 ng/mL (Varies based on condition/patient)
*   **Factors to Consider**
    *   Clinical picture: Underlying cardio condition and additional meds
    *   Electrolyte levels: Potassium, Magnesium

    *   The patient’s additional meds
    *   The patient’s liver/kidney function
*   **Clinical Significance:** To maintain safe and therapeutic levels

## **Limitations in Interpretations** {-}

*   **Cut-off Values:** They are set for specific tests
