## **Diabetes Mellitus (DM)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both
*   **Types**
    *   Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM): Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency
    *   Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM): Progressive insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency
    *   Gestational Diabetes (GDM): Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy
    *   Other specific types of diabetes: Due to genetic defects, medications, or other conditions
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on more than one occasion
    *   **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
    *   **HbA1c:** ≥ 6.5%
    *   **Random Plasma Glucose:** ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss)
    *   **Urine Glucose:** Positive (in cases of significant hyperglycemia)
    *   **Ketones:** Positive (especially in T1DM with uncontrolled hyperglycemia)
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Elevated FPG, OGTT, and HbA1c levels are diagnostic of diabetes mellitus
    *   The severity of hyperglycemia correlates with the risk of developing long-term complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease)

*   **Diagnosis**
    *   Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with a 75-gram or 100-gram glucose load
    *   Diagnostic criteria vary depending on the organization (e.g., ADA, WHO, IADPSG)
    *   Common criteria (Carpenter-Coustan, 100-gram OGTT):
        *   Fasting ≥ 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)
        *   1-hour ≥ 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
        *   2-hour ≥ 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)
        *   3-hour ≥ 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
