# Procedures {-}

This section covers the various facets of laboratory test procedures in TDM

## **General Principles of TDM Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To accurately measure drug concentrations in biological samples to optimize therapy and minimize toxicity
*   **Analytical Methods**
    *   Immunoassays: Based on antibody-antigen binding
    *   Chromatography: Separates and quantifies drugs based on their properties
*   **Sample Types**
    *   Serum, plasma, whole blood (depending on the drug)
*   **Reporting Units**
    *   ng/mL, Î¼g/mL, mg/L, etc

## **Immunoassay Methods** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   Utilizes specific antibodies to bind to the drug being measured
    *   The antibody-drug complex is then detected and quantified
*   **Types**
    *   Competitive Immunoassays: Drug in sample competes with labeled drug
    *   Non-Competitive Immunoassays: Antibody binds directly to the drug
    *   Homogeneous Immunoassays: No separation steps
    *   Heterogeneous Immunoassays: Require separation steps
*   **Examples**
    *   Enzyme-Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT)
    *   Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA)
    *   Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA)
*   **Advantages:** High throughput, ease of use, and automation
*   **Limitations:** Potential for cross-reactivity, matrix effects, and interference from heterophile antibodies

## **Chromatographic Methods** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   Separates drugs and metabolites based on physical and chemical properties
    *   Quantifies the separated compounds using various detectors
*   **Types**
    *   High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
    *   Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
    *   Gas Chromatography (GC)
*   **Detectors**
    *   UV-Vis, fluorescence, mass spectrometry
*   **Advantages:** High specificity and sensitivity, ability to measure multiple drugs/metabolites simultaneously
*   **Limitations:** More complex, requires skilled operators, and more expensive than immunoassays

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Timing of dose: Collect samples at appropriate times (trough, peak)
    *   Medication history: Document all medications and supplements
    *   Fasting requirements: May be needed for some tests
*   **Sample Collection**
    *   Use correct collection tubes
    *   Follow the correct order of draw
    *   Proper venipuncture technique to minimize hemolysis
    *   Label specimens immediately and accurately
*   **Sample Handling**
    *   Process promptly
    *   Aliquot correctly
    *   Store at correct temperature
    *   Protect from light if necessary

## **Specimen Collection and Processing** {-}

*   **Specimen Types:** Serum, plasma, whole blood
*   **Collection Tubes:** SST, EDTA, heparin
*   **Centrifugation:** Centrifuge promptly after collection
*   **Separation:** Separate serum or plasma from cells within the specified time frame
*   **Storage:** Refrigerate or freeze samples at recommended temperatures

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **High Drug Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Wrong collection time, medication administration error, contamination
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent issues, interferences
*   **Low Drug Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Wrong collection time, degradation, improper storage
    *   Analytical: Calibration issues, reagent problems, interferences
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Patient variability, handling errors
    *   Analytical: Assay variability, interferences
*   **Quality Control (QC) Failures**
    *   Pre-analytical: QC improperly stored or expired
    *   Analytical: Calibration errors, reagent issues, instrument malfunction
    *   Investigate and correct the source of the error

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Hemolysis:** Can interfere with immunoassays
*   **Lipemia:** Can cause turbidity and affect spectrophotometric assays
*   **Bilirubin:** Can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
*   **Drugs:** Other drugs can interfere with the assay or affect drug levels
*   **Heterophile Antibodies:** Can cause falsely high or low results
*   **Cross-Reactivity:** Antibodies may bind to other substances
*   **Matrix Effects:** Components in the sample matrix can affect results
