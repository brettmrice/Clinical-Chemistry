# Properties {-}

This section outlines the chemical and physical properties of key drug classes monitored in TDM

## **General Overview of Chemical and Physical Properties in TDM** {-}

*   **Importance:** Understanding the chemical and physical properties of drugs is critical for comprehending their ADME processes, mechanism of action, analytical methods, and TDM
*   **Properties Influencing ADME**
    *   Solubility: Affects absorption and excretion
    *   Ionization: Impacts absorption, distribution, and renal excretion
    *   Protein Binding: Influences distribution and free drug concentration
    *   Partition Coefficient (Log P): Affects membrane permeability and distribution

## **Drug Classes and Properties** {-}

### **Aminoglycosides (e.g., Gentamicin)** {-}

*   **Chemical Structure:** Steroid nucleus linked to a lactone ring and sugar molecules
*   **Molecular Weight:** Approximately 780 g/mol
*   **Solubility:** Slightly soluble in water
*   **Ionization:** Variable, depends on functional groups
*   **Protein Binding:** Moderate protein binding (20-30%)
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Oral bioavailability varies, distributes widely, renal excretion
*   **Analytical Methods:** Immunoassays, chromatography

### **Anticonvulsants (e.g., Phenobarbital)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Used to prevent or control seizures
*   **Chemical Structure:** Barbiturate
*   **Molecular Weight:** Approximately 232 g/mol
*   **Solubility:** Slightly soluble in water
*   **Ionization:** Weakly acidic
*   **Protein Binding:** Moderate protein binding (45-60%)
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Oral bioavailability, extensive metabolism in the liver, renal excretion (pH-dependent)
*   **Analytical Methods:** Immunoassays, chromatography

### **Antidepressants (e.g., Lithium)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Used to treat depression and mood disorders
*   **Chemical Structure:** Simplest structure in the antidepressents, with only a single charge
*   **Molecular Weight:** Approximately 7 g/mol
*   **Solubility:** Lithium salts soluble in water
*   **Ionization:** Exists as a monovalent cation ($Li^+$) in solution
*   **Protein Binding:** Negligible protein binding
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Rapid and complete oral absorption, distributes throughout total body water, renal excretion
*   **Analytical Methods:** Flame Emission Spectrophotometry (FES), Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE), Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)

### **Immunosuppressants (e.g., Tacrolimus)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Used to prevent organ rejection and treat autoimmune diseases
*   **Chemical Structure:** Macrolide lactone
*   **Molecular Weight:** Approximately 804 g/mol
*   **Solubility:** Practically insoluble in water
*   **Ionization:** Not applicable
*   **Protein Binding:** Highly protein-bound (approximately 99%)
*   **Pharmacokinetic Implications:** Low and variable oral bioavailability, extensive metabolism in the liver, biliary excretion
*   **Analytical Methods:** Immunoassays, chromatography (LC-MS/MS)
