# Precautions {-}

Reliable electrolyte measurements depend on careful technique

*   Pre-analytical factors
*   Analytical factors
*   Potential interferences

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Fasting: Some electrolyte tests require fasting to minimize interferences from lipemia
    *   Medications: Certain drugs can affect electrolyte levels. Review the patient's medication list
    *   Hydration Status: Assess hydration, as dehydration or overhydration can affect electrolyte concentrations
*   **Specimen Type**
    *   Serum is the most common specimen type for electrolyte measurements
    *   Plasma may be used for some electrolyte assays, but follow the laboratory's guidelines for anticoagulant selection
    *   Whole blood is used for some point-of-care testing (POCT) devices
*   **Tube Type**
    *   Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes are commonly used for serum collection
    *   Plasma tubes with lithium heparin are often used for plasma collection
*   **Order of Draw**
    *   Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes to prevent cross-contamination
*   **Tourniquet Time**
    *   Minimize tourniquet time (ideally less than 1 minute) to prevent hemoconcentration
*   **Collection Technique**
    *   Use a clean venipuncture technique to minimize hemolysis. Avoid prolonged probing or excessive force
    *   Avoid drawing blood from an arm with an intravenous (IV) line, if possible

## **Specimen Handling and Processing** {-}

*   **Timing**
    *   Process the specimen as soon as possible after collection to prevent changes in electrolyte concentrations due to cellular metabolism
    *   Analyze potassium levels promptly, as potassium can be released from cells during storage, leading to falsely elevated results
*   **Centrifugation**
    *   Centrifuge the sample according to the manufacturer's instructions for the specific tube type
    *   Proper centrifugation ensures complete separation of serum or plasma from cells
*   **Storage**
    *   If analysis is delayed, store the specimen refrigerated (2-8°C) for short-term storage or frozen (-20°C or -70°C) for longer storage
    *   Aliquot the sample into smaller portions to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which can affect electrolyte concentrations
*   **Hemolysis**
    *   Avoid hemolysis, as red blood cells contain high concentrations of potassium and phosphate, which can falsely elevate results
    *   Visually inspect the sample for hemolysis and reject hemolyzed samples
*   **Lipemia**
    *   Lipemia (excess lipids) can interfere with spectrophotometric assays
    *   Use lipemia clearing techniques (ultracentrifugation, lipid clearing reagents) or consider methods less affected by turbidity
*   **Precipitation**
    *   Be aware of precipitation with calcium and magnesium, which may lead to false results

## **Analytical Considerations** {-}

*   **Reagent Quality**
    *   Use high-quality reagents and store them according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Check expiration dates and discard expired reagents
*   **Calibration**
    *   Calibrate the instrument regularly using appropriate standards
    *   Use multiple calibrators to ensure linearity over the entire measurement range
*   **Quality Control (QC)**
    *   Run quality control samples at regular intervals to monitor the accuracy and precision of the assay
    *   Use both normal and abnormal QC levels to assess performance across the entire range
    *   Evaluate QC results before releasing patient results
*   **Instrumentation**
    *   Regularly maintain and service the instrument according to the manufacturer's recommendations
    *   Ensure the instrument is functioning properly and that all components are in good working order
*   **Method Validation**
    *   Validate new methods before implementation to ensure accuracy, precision, linearity, and other performance characteristics
    *   Reference ranges may vary depending on the age of the patient

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Endogenous**
    *   Lipemia: Causes turbidity, affecting spectrophotometric readings
    *   Bilirubin: Absorbs light at similar wavelengths, affecting absorbance readings
    *   Hemoglobin: Released from hemolyzed red blood cells, interfering with enzymatic reactions
    *   High Protein Concentrations: Can interfere with enzymatic assays by affecting the reaction kinetics or detection system
*   **Exogenous**
    *   Medications: Certain drugs can directly affect electrolyte levels
    *   Anticoagulants: Some anticoagulants can interfere with enzymatic reactions
    *   Contaminants: Improperly cleaned glassware or containers can introduce contaminants that affect assay performance
*   **Pseudohyponatremia**
    *   Occurs with marked hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia
    *   Sodium concentration appears lower due to volume displacement
    *   Direct ISE methods are less susceptible to this interference
*   **Chloride ISE Interference**
    *   Bromide can interfere with chloride ISE methods
    *   Sweat Contamination: High chloride content

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Unexpectedly High Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Patient not fasting
        *   Prolonged tourniquet time
        *   Hemolysis
        *   Improper collection tube
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
        *   Interfering substances
        *   Instrument malfunction
*   **Unexpectedly Low Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Improper storage
        *   Analyte degradation
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
        *   Instrument malfunction
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Check patient preparation
    *   Review collection and processing procedures
    *   Evaluate reagent quality and calibration
    *   Consider interfering substances
    *   Repeat the test using a different method or on a new sample
*   **Out-of-Control QC**
    *   Check the integrity of the QC materials
    *   Prepare fresh QC materials
    *   Re-calibrate the instrument
    *   Review reagent quality
    *   Repeat the QC testing
    *   If the problem persists, contact the instrument manufacturer for assistance
*   **Lipemia:** Can cause an electrolyte imbalance or a false interference. Correct by either using direct ISEs or by clearing the lipemia
*   **Icterus:** Can cause interference, so ensure testing reagents are correct and appropriate for testing interferences
*   **Hemolysis:** Can release the electrolytic components from within the cell, skewing the results if precautions are not taken
