This section covers the laboratory analysis of vitamins and nutrients

## **General Principles of Vitamin and Nutrient Analysis** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To measure the levels of vitamins and nutrients in biological samples for the assessment of nutritional status
*   **Analytical Techniques**
    *   Spectrophotometry
    *   Fluorometry
    *   Immunoassays (ELISA, CLIA)
    *   Chromatography (HPLC, GC, TLC)
    *   Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
    *   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)
    *   Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
    *   Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Fasting: Required for some tests
    *   Medications: Some drugs interfere with nutrient tests
    *   Supplements: Avoid before testing
    *   Alcohol Consumption: Affects absorption and metabolism
    *   Timing: Important due to diurnal variations
*   **Specimen Collection**
    *   Use appropriate collection tubes
    *   Follow the correct order of draw
    *   Use proper venipuncture technique
    *   Label specimens immediately and accurately
    *   Collect the correct volume of blood
*   **Specimen Processing**
    *   Centrifuge promptly after collection
    *   Separate serum or plasma from cells within the specified time frame
    *   Aliquot specimens into appropriate containers
    *   Store specimens at the appropriate temperature
    *   Thaw specimens properly before testing
    *   Light Protection: Especially important for certain vitamins

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **High Nutrient Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Patient not fasting, recent supplement intake, medication interference, improper collection tube, delayed processing, contamination of specimen
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, interfering substances, cross-reactivity, non-specific binding
*   **Low Nutrient Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Improper collection tube, delayed processing, improper storage, medication interference
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, interfering substances, assay drift
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Pre-analytical: Patient variability, specimen handling errors
    *   Analytical: Assay variability, interfering substances, cross-reactivity
    *   Post-analytical: Transcription errors, reporting errors
*   **Quality Control Failures**
    *   Pre-analytical: QC material improperly stored, QC material expired
    *   Analytical: Incorrect calibration, reagent deterioration, instrument malfunction
    *   Action: Investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Hemolysis:** Releases intracellular components
*   **Lipemia:** Interferes with spectrophotometric assays
*   **Bilirubin:** Interferes with spectrophotometric assays
*   **Drugs:** Directly affect nutrient levels or interfere with assays
*   **Heterophile Antibodies:** Cause falsely high or low results
*   **Cross-Reactivity:** Antibodies may cross-react with structurally similar compounds
*   **Biotin:** Interferes with biotin-streptavidin assays
*   **Ascorbic Acid:** Interferes with certain assays by acting as a reducing agent
*   **Homocysteine:** Interferes with folate and vitamin B12 assays

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical:** Processes before sample analysis
*   **Analytical:** Processes involved in sample analysis
*   **Post-Analytical:** Processes after sample analysis
*   **Interfering Substance:** Affects test accuracy
*   **Calibration:** Adjusting an instrument for accurate readings
*   **Quality Control:** Measures to ensure test accuracy and precision
*   **Hemolysis:** Breakdown of red blood cells
*   **Lipemia:** Excess lipids in the blood
