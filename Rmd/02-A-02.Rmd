# Procedures {-}

Enzymes play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring various diseases. Understanding the principles of enzyme assays, along with proper pre-analytical and analytical techniques, is essential for generating accurate and reliable results

## **Principles of Enzyme Assays** {-}

*   **Kinetic Assays:** Measure the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions continuously
*   **Fixed-Time Assays:** Measure the amount of product formed or substrate consumed at a single point in time
*   **Enzyme Activity Assays:** Measure the catalytic activity of the enzyme
*   **Enzyme Concentration Assays:** Measure the amount of enzyme protein present

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Fasting: Some enzymes require fasting
    *   Medications: Certain medications can affect enzyme levels
    *   Recent Procedures: Defer testing if affected
    *   Exercise: Strenuous exercise can elevate some levels
*   **Specimen Type:** Serum is the most common, some use plasma
*   **Tube Type:** Follow lab guidelines
*   **Order of Draw:** Follow the CLSI or other standards
*   **Tourniquet Time:** Keep this short to avoid hemoconcentration
*   **Collection Technique:** Clean venipuncture to avoid hemolysis

## **Specimen Handling and Processing** {-}

*   **Timing:** Process ASAP
*   **Centrifugation:** Follow instructions
*   **Storage:** Refrigerate or freeze, avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
*   **Hemolysis:** Avoid and reject hemolyzed samples

## **Analytical Considerations** {-}

*   **Reagent Quality:** Store reagents according to instructions, check expiration dates
*   **Calibration:** Use appropriate standards, calibrate regularly
*   **Quality Control (QC):** Run controls regularly, evaluate results before releasing data
*   **Instrumentation:** Maintain and service instruments per schedule
*   **Method Validation:** Validate new methods

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Endogenous:** Lipemia, bilirubin, hemoglobin, urea, high protein concentrations
*   **Exogenous:** Medications, anticoagulants, contaminants
*   **Minimizing Interferences**
    *   Use interference-reducing techniques
    *   Dilute sample (if appropriate)
    *   Employ blanking or background subtraction

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **High Enzyme Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical: Patient factors, collection/processing errors
    *   Analytical: Calibration, reagents, interferences, instruments
*   **Low Enzyme Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical: Enzyme degradation, improper storage
    *   Analytical: Calibration, reagents, instrument issues
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Check patient factors, collection/processing, reagents/calibration, interferences, and instruments
*   **Out-of-Control QC:** Troubleshoot QC materials, calibration, reagents, and instruments

## **Key Considerations** {-}

*   Following proper technique will yield reliable lab test results
*   High clinical judgement is recommended to produce an accurate diagnosis
