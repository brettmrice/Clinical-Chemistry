Blood gases and pH are vital for homeostasis

## **Acid-Base Balance** {-}

*   **Definition of Acids and Bases**
    *   Acid: A substance that donates protons ($H^+$)
    *   Base: A substance that accepts protons ($H^+$)
*   **pH Scale**
    *   $pH = -log[H^+] = -log[H_3O^+]$
    *   Ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral
    *   pH < 7: Acidic
    *   pH > 7: Basic (alkaline)
*   **Normal Blood pH:** 7.35-7.45
*   **Importance of Acid-Base Balance**
    *   Optimal enzyme function
    *   Maintenance of cell membrane integrity
    *   Appropriate protein structure and function
    *   Electrolyte balance
*   **Acidemia:** Blood pH < 7.35
*   **Alkalemia:** Blood pH > 7.45
*   **Major Buffer Systems in the Body**
    *   Bicarbonate Buffer System: Primary buffer system in extracellular fluid
    *   Hemoglobin Buffer System: Buffers pH changes within red blood cells
    *   Phosphate Buffer System: Important in intracellular fluid and urine
    *   Protein Buffer System: Buffers pH changes in intracellular and extracellular fluid

## **Biochemical Theory** {-}

*   **Sources of Acids and Bases**
    *   Volatile Acid: Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), produced during metabolism, is converted to carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$)
          *   $CO_2$ + $H_2O$ ↔ $H_2CO_3$ ↔ $H^+$ + $HCO_3^-$
          *   The lungs regulate $CO_2$ levels through ventilation
    *   Nonvolatile Acids: Produced from the metabolism of proteins and other organic compounds
          *   Examples: Sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, ketoacids
          *   The kidneys excrete nonvolatile acids
    *   Bases: Generated through metabolic processes, but less significant than acid production

## **Regulation of Acid-Base Balance** {-}

*   **Buffer Systems**
    *   Act immediately to resist pH changes
    *   Do not eliminate acids or bases from the body
*   **Respiratory System**
    *   Regulates $CO_2$ levels through ventilation
    *   Responds rapidly (within minutes) to pH changes
*   **Renal System**
    *   Excretes nonvolatile acids and regenerates bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$)
    *   Responds slowly (over hours to days) to pH changes
*   **Compensation Mechanisms**
    *   Respiratory Compensation: The lungs adjust ventilation to change $CO_2$ levels in response to metabolic acid-base disturbances
    *   Renal Compensation: The kidneys adjust $HCO_3^-$ excretion and $H^+$ secretion to compensate for respiratory acid-base disturbances

## **Respiratory Control** {-}

*   **Ventilation**
    *   Increased Ventilation: Blows off $CO_2$, decreases $H_2CO_3$, and raises pH
    *   Decreased Ventilation: Retains $CO_2$, increases $H_2CO_3$, and lowers pH
*   **Chemoreceptors**
    *   Central Chemoreceptors: Located in the medulla oblongata and respond to changes in pH and $CO_2$ levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
    *   Peripheral Chemoreceptors: Located in the carotid and aortic bodies and respond to changes in pH, $CO_2$, and $O_2$ levels in the blood
*   **Response to Acidosis**
    *   Increased ventilation to blow off $CO_2$ and raise pH
*   **Response to Alkalosis**
    *   Decreased ventilation to retain $CO_2$ and lower pH

## **Renal Control** {-}

*   **Bicarbonate Reabsorption**
    *   Most bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule
    *   Involves the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and the secretion of $H^+$ into the tubular lumen
*   **Acid Excretion**
    *   $H^+$ is secreted into the tubular lumen
    *   $H^+$ combines with buffers such as phosphate ($HPO_4^{2-}$) and ammonia ($NH_3$) to form titratable acid ($H_2PO_4^-$) and ammonium ($NH_4^+$)
    *   Ammonia is produced from glutamine in the proximal tubule
*   **Response to Acidosis**
    *   Increased $H^+$ secretion
    *   Increased bicarbonate reabsorption
    *   Increased ammonia production
*   **Response to Alkalosis**
    *   Decreased $H^+$ secretion
    *   Decreased bicarbonate reabsorption

## **Acid-Base Imbalances** {-}

*   **Acidosis:** A condition in which the blood pH is below the normal range (< 7.35)
    *   Respiratory Acidosis: Caused by increased $CO_2$ levels (decreased ventilation)
    *   Metabolic Acidosis: Caused by decreased $HCO_3^-$ levels or increased nonvolatile acid production
*   **Alkalosis:** A condition in which the blood pH is above the normal range (> 7.45)
    *   Respiratory Alkalosis: Caused by decreased $CO_2$ levels (increased ventilation)
    *   Metabolic Alkalosis: Caused by increased $HCO_3^-$ levels or decreased nonvolatile acid levels

## **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation** {-}

*   **Equation**
    *   $pH = pKa + \log \left( \frac {[A^-]} {[HA]} \right)$
        *   $pH$: Measure of acidity or basicity
        *   $pKa$: The negative log of the acid dissociation constant (Ka), indicating the strength of an acid
        *   \[$A^-$]: Concentration of the conjugate base
        *   \[$HA$]: Concentration of the weak acid
*   **Application to Bicarbonate Buffer System**
    *   $pH = 6.1 + \log \left( {\frac {[HCO_3^-]} {0.03 \times PaCO_2}} \right)$
        *   6.1 = $pKa$ of carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$)
        *   [$HCO_3^-$] = Concentration of bicarbonate in mmol/L
        *   Pa$CO_2$ = Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mmHg
        *   0.03 = Solubility coefficient of $CO_2$ in blood (converts Pa$CO_2$ to [$H_2CO_3$])
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes the relationship between pH, bicarbonate, and Pa$CO_2$ in the blood
    *   It is used to assess acid-base balance and to determine the cause of acid-base disturbances
    *   Changes in bicarbonate and Pa$CO_2$ affect the pH, and the body uses compensation mechanisms to maintain the pH within the normal range
