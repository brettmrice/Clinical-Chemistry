## **Phospholipids** {-}

*   **Structure**
    *   **Glycerol Backbone:** A three-carbon molecule
    *   **Fatty Acid Tails:** Two fatty acids attached to the glycerol backbone via ester bonds. One is saturated and the other is unsaturated
    *   **Phosphate Group:** A phosphate group attached to the third carbon of glycerol, linked to a polar head group
    *   **Polar Head Group:** Varies (e.g., choline, serine, ethanolamine, inositol)
*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Amphipathic Nature:** They have both hydrophobic (fatty acid tails) and hydrophilic (polar head group) regions
    *   **Bilayer Formation:** In aqueous solutions, phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers, with the hydrophobic tails facing inward and the hydrophilic head groups facing outward
    *   **Fluidity:** The fluidity of the bilayer depends on the saturation of the fatty acid tails and the presence of cholesterol
*   **Chemical Properties**
    *   **Hydrolysis:** Phospholipids can be hydrolyzed by phospholipases, releasing fatty acids and other molecules
    *   **Cell Signaling:** Some phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylinositol) play a role in cell signaling pathways
    *   **Membrane Structure:** They are essential components of cell membranes, providing structure and flexibility
