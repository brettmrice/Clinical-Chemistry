### **Chemical** {-}

*   **Cyclization:**
    *   Monosaccharides with five or more carbon atoms can cyclize in aqueous solution, forming cyclic hemiacetals (from aldehydes) or hemiketals (from ketones)
    *   **Anomers:** The cyclization process creates a new chiral center at the carbonyl carbon (anomeric carbon), resulting in α and β anomers
