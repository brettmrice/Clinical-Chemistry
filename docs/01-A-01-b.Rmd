## **Physiologic States in Carbohydrate Metabolism** {-}
*   **Normal State:**
    *   **Normoglycemia:**
        *   Maintained within a tight range by hormones like insulin and glucagon
        *   Provides a constant energy supply, especially for the brain

*   **Abnormal States:**
    *   **Hyperglycemia:** High blood glucose, often due to diabetes (lack of insulin or insulin resistance). Can cause acute (DKA, HHS) and chronic (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease) complications
    *   **Hypoglycemia:** Low blood glucose, due to excess insulin, liver/kidney disease, or other factors. Can cause neurological symptoms, seizures, coma, and brain damage
    *   **Insulin Resistance:** Cells don't respond to insulin, leading to high insulin levels and increased risk of type 2 diabetes
    *   **Genetic Disorders:**
        *   **Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSDs):** Enzyme deficiencies in glycogen metabolism leading to glycogen accumulation and hypoglycemia
        *   **Galactosemia:** Enzyme deficiencies in galactose metabolism leading to accumulation of galactose and organ damage
        *   **Fructose Intolerance:** Enzyme deficiencies in fructose metabolism leading to accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and organ damage
        *   **Pentosuria:** Benign condition, deficiency in L-xylulose reductase which is required for the metabolism of L-xylulose

## **Normal Sate** {-}

### **Normoglycemia** {-}

*   **Definition:** Normal blood glucose levels
*   **Fasting:** 70-99 mg/dL (3.9-5.5 mmol/L)
*   **Postprandial (2 hours after eating):** < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
*   **Maintenance:** A complex interplay of hormones (insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol), liver function, and cellular glucose uptake maintains normoglycemia
*   **Importance:** Provides a constant supply of glucose for energy, especially for the brain, which relies heavily on glucose

## **Abnormal States** {-}

### **Hyperglycemia** {-}

*   **Definition:** Abnormally high blood glucose levels
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2):**
        *   **Type 1:** Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency
        *   **Type 2:** Insulin resistance (cells don't respond properly to insulin) and relative insulin deficiency (pancreas can't produce enough insulin to overcome resistance)
    *   **Gestational Diabetes:** Insulin resistance during pregnancy
    *   **Other Endocrine Disorders:** Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol), acromegaly (excess growth hormone), hyperthyroidism
    *   **Pancreatic Diseases:** Pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis (affecting pancreatic function)
    *   **Medications:** Corticosteroids, some diuretics
    *   **Stress/Illness:** Stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine) can raise blood glucose
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Classic Symptoms:** Polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), unexplained weight loss
    *   **Other Symptoms:** Fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, frequent infections
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Acute:**
        *   **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):** Primarily in Type 1 diabetes. Insulin deficiency leads to increased lipolysis, ketone body production, and metabolic acidosis
        *   **Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS):** Primarily in Type 2 diabetes. Severe hyperglycemia leads to dehydration and hyperosmolarity, but less ketosis than DKA
    *   **Chronic:**
        *   **Microvascular Complications:**
            *   **Retinopathy:** Damage to blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss
            *   **Nephropathy:** Damage to blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney failure
            *   **Neuropathy:** Damage to nerves, leading to pain, numbness, and loss of sensation
        *   **Macrovascular Complications:**
            *   **Cardiovascular Disease:** Increased risk of heart attacks and strokes
            *   **Peripheral Artery Disease:** Reduced blood flow to the limbs, increasing the risk of amputation

### **Hypoglycemia** {-}

*   **Definition:** Abnormally low blood glucose levels
*   **Threshold:** Generally defined as < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), but symptoms can vary
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Excess Insulin:**
        *   **Insulin Overdose:** In diabetic patients
        *   **Insulinoma:** Insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreas
    *   **Reactive Hypoglycemia:** Exaggerated insulin release after a meal
    *   **Fasting Hypoglycemia:**
        *   **Liver Disease:** Impaired gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage
        *   **Kidney Disease:** Impaired gluconeogenesis
        *   **Hormone Deficiencies:** Adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol), growth hormone deficiency
        *   **Certain Tumors:** Non-islet cell tumors can secrete insulin-like substances
    *   **Alcohol Consumption:** Inhibits gluconeogenesis
    *   **Intense Exercise:** Can deplete glycogen stores
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Adrenergic Symptoms (Early):** Sweating, shakiness, anxiety, palpitations, hunger
    *   **Neuroglycopenic Symptoms (Later):** Confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, difficulty speaking, seizures, loss of consciousness
*   **Complications:**
    *   **Brain Damage:** Prolonged or severe hypoglycemia can lead to irreversible brain damage
    *   **Seizures**
    *   **Coma**
    *   **Death**

### **Insulin Resistance** {-}

*   **Definition:** Cells don't respond normally to insulin, requiring higher levels of insulin to achieve the same effect on glucose uptake
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Obesity:** Excess adipose tissue releases factors that interfere with insulin signaling
    *   **Genetics:** Some individuals are genetically predisposed to insulin resistance
    *   **Physical Inactivity**

    *   **Hyperinsulinemia:** Elevated insulin levels as the pancreas tries to compensate for resistance
    *   **Prediabetes:** Impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance
    *   **Type 2 Diabetes:** Eventually, the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin to overcome resistance
    *   **Metabolic Syndrome:** A cluster of conditions including insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes

### **Genetic Defects in Glycogen Metabolism** {-}
