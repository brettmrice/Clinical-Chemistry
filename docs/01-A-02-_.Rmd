# Procedures {-}

Carbohydrate testing is all about assessing glucose levels to diagnose and monitor diabetes, while also looking for other specific sugars tied to metabolic disorders. We use a variety of techniques to get a comprehensive picture of how the body is handling sugars

## **Key Tests & Principles** {-}

*   **Glucose Measurement**
    *   **Principle:** Uses enzymatic reactions (glucose oxidase or hexokinase) to quantify glucose
    *   We're measuring the products or byproducts of these enzyme-catalyzed reactions
*   **Glucose Tolerance Testing (GTT)**
    *   **Principle:** Measures the body's ability to clear glucose from the blood after a challenge dose
    *   This assesses both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity
*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)**
    *   **Principle:** Quantifies the percentage of hemoglobin that has glucose attached, reflecting average glucose levels over 2-3 months
    *   Provides a long-term view of glycemic control
*   **Urine Glucose**
    *   **Principle:** Detects the presence of glucose in urine when blood glucose exceeds the kidney's reabsorption capacity
    *   A quick, but less sensitive, way to check for high blood sugar
*   **Ketone Measurement**
    *   **Principle:** Detects ketones in blood or urine, indicating fat breakdown due to insufficient glucose use
    *   Important in diagnosing and monitoring diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
*   **Other Carbohydrate Tests**
    *   **Principle:** Uses specialized enzymatic or chromatographic methods to quantify other sugars like galactose or fructose
    *   Used for diagnosing specific metabolic disorders

## **Factors Affecting Results** {-}

*   **Special Precautions**
    *   **Patient Prep:** Includes proper fasting, awareness of medications, and consideration of acute illness
    *   **Specimen Handling:** Involves prompt processing, appropriate temperature control, and use of the correct anticoagulants
    *   **Reagent Quality:** Proper storage and awareness of expiration dates are essential
*   **Troubleshooting**
    *   We need to be able to identify the source of errors (pre-analytical, analytical) if results are unexpected
*   **Interfering Substances**
    *   Substances like ascorbic acid (vitamin C), bilirubin, lipids, and hemoglobin can affect certain assays
    *   Knowing about these interferences helps us choose the best methods and interpret results correctly

## **Interpretation & Disease Correlation** {-}

*   **Normoglycemia & Aberrations:** Understanding normal ranges for all these tests is foundational
*   **Linking Labs to Disease:** Recognizing how specific test patterns correlate with conditions like diabetes, prediabetes, gestational diabetes, hypoglycemia, DKA, and other metabolic disorders is the ultimate goal
*   **Putting in Context:** Remembering that patient factors, medications, and even ethnicity can influence lab results makes interpretation more nuanced
