Heme derivatives play critical roles in oxygen transport, electron transfer, and detoxification. Understanding heme metabolism is essential for interpreting various clinical conditions

## **Heme Derivatives** {-}

*   **Definition:** Heme is a porphyrin ring complex with a central iron atom (usually in the Fe2+ ferrous state). It's a prosthetic group essential for the function of various proteins
*   **Examples**
    *   Hemoglobin: Oxygen transport in red blood cells
    *   Myoglobin: Oxygen storage in muscle cells
    *   Cytochromes: Electron transport in mitochondria
    *   Catalase and Peroxidase: Detoxification of hydrogen peroxide
    *   Tryptophan Pyrrolase: Catalyzes the first step in the catabolism of tryptophan
*   **Key Metabolic Pathways**
    *   Heme Synthesis: Production of heme in the bone marrow and liver
    *   Heme Degradation: Breakdown of heme in the spleen and liver, leading to bilirubin formation

## **Heme Synthesis** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To produce heme, which is essential for hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, and other heme-containing proteins
*   **Location:** Bone marrow (primarily for hemoglobin synthesis) and liver (for cytochromes and other heme proteins)
*   **Subcellular Location:** Initial steps in mitochondria, intermediate steps in cytosol, and final steps back in mitochondria
*   **Process**
    1.  **Glycine + Succinyl CoA → δ-Aminolevulinate (ALA)**
        *   Catalyzed by ALA synthase (rate-limiting enzyme) in mitochondria
        *   Requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor
    2.  **2 ALA → Porphobilinogen (PBG)**
        *   Catalyzed by ALA dehydratase (also known as porphobilinogen synthase) in the cytosol
        *   Inhibited by lead
    3.  **4 PBG → Protoporphyrin**
        *   A series of enzymatic reactions in the cytosol convert four molecules of PBG into protoporphyrin
    4.  **Protoporphyrin + Fe2+ → Heme**
        *   Catalyzed by ferrochelatase in mitochondria
        *   Inhibited by lead
*   **Regulation**
    *   ALA synthase is the rate-limiting enzyme and is regulated by:
        *   Heme: Inhibits ALA synthase (feedback inhibition)
        *   Erythropoietin: Stimulates ALA synthase (in erythroid cells)
        *   Drugs and Steroid Hormones: Can induce ALA synthase (in liver)

## **Heme Degradation** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To breakdown heme from aged or damaged red blood cells and recycle its components
*   **Location:** Primarily in the spleen and liver
*   **Process**
    1.  **Heme → Biliverdin**
        *   Catalyzed by heme oxygenase in macrophages
        *   Heme oxygenase opens the porphyrin ring, releasing iron (Fe2+) and carbon monoxide (CO)
    2.  **Biliverdin → Bilirubin**
        *   Catalyzed by biliverdin reductase in macrophages
        *   Bilirubin is insoluble in water (unconjugated bilirubin)
    3.  **Bilirubin → Bilirubin-Albumin Complex**
        *   Bilirubin is transported in the blood bound to albumin
        *   Albumin increases the solubility of bilirubin
    4.  **Uptake by Liver**
        *   The bilirubin-albumin complex is taken up by hepatocytes
        *   Bilirubin dissociates from albumin and is transported into the hepatocyte
    5.  **Conjugation of Bilirubin**
        *   Bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) in the endoplasmic reticulum
        *   Conjugation makes bilirubin water-soluble (conjugated bilirubin)
    6.  **Secretion into Bile**
        *   Conjugated bilirubin is secreted into bile and transported to the small intestine
    7.  **Conversion to Urobilinogen**
        *   In the intestine, bacteria convert conjugated bilirubin to urobilinogen
    8.  **Fate of Urobilinogen**
        *   Most of the urobilinogen is excreted in the feces as stercobilin (gives feces its brown color)
        *   A small amount of urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood and excreted in the urine as urobilin (gives urine its yellow color)

## **Iron Metabolism** {-}

*   **Importance:** Iron is a crucial component of heme and is tightly regulated
*   **Dietary Iron:** Absorbed in the small intestine
*   **Transport:** Transported in the blood bound to transferrin
*   **Storage:** Stored in cells as ferritin or hemosiderin
*   **Regulation:** Hepcidin, a hormone produced by the liver, regulates iron absorption and release

## **Porphyrias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of genetic disorders caused by deficiencies in enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway
*   **Types:** Different types are characterized by the specific enzyme deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Vary depending on the type of porphyria
*   **Diagnosis:** Based on elevated levels of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in urine, blood, and feces

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Heme:** A porphyrin ring complex with a central iron atom
*   **ALA Synthase:** The rate-limiting enzyme in heme synthesis
*   **ALA Dehydratase:** An enzyme in heme synthesis inhibited by lead
*   **Ferrochelatase:** An enzyme in heme synthesis that inserts iron into protoporphyrin, inhibited by lead
*   **Heme Oxygenase:** An enzyme that breaks down heme into biliverdin
*   **Biliverdin Reductase:** An enzyme that converts biliverdin to bilirubin
*   **UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT):** An enzyme that conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid
*   **Urobilinogen:** A product of bilirubin degradation in the intestine
*   **Porphyrias:** Genetic disorders caused by deficiencies in enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway
*   **Hepcidin:** A hormone that regulates iron absorption and release
