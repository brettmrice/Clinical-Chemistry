## **Patient Preparation** {-}
*   **Fasting:** Patients should typically fast for 9-12 hours before lipid testing
*   Rationale: Fasting is essential because triglyceride levels are significantly affected by recent food intake. Non-fasting samples can lead to falsely elevated triglyceride levels, affecting LDL cholesterol calculations
*   **Medications:** Certain medications can affect lipid levels
    *   Examples: Statins, fibrates, niacin, beta-blockers, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids
    *   Action: The healthcare provider should review the patient's medication list and determine if any medications need to be temporarily discontinued before testing. Document all medications the patient is taking
*   **Recent Illness/Surgery:** Acute illness, surgery, or trauma can affect lipid levels
    *   Rationale: Stress and inflammation can temporarily alter lipid metabolism
    *   Action: Testing should be deferred until the patient has recovered from the acute event. Note any recent illnesses or surgeries on the test request form
*   **Posture:** The patient should be seated for at least 5 minutes before blood collection
    *   Rationale: Prolonged standing can affect plasma volume and lipid concentrations
    *   Action: Ensure the patient is comfortably seated before venipuncture

## **Specimen Collection** {-}
*   **Tube Type:** Serum separator tubes (SST) or plasma tubes with EDTA are commonly used
*   Rationale: SSTs allow for easy separation of serum, while EDTA tubes provide plasma samples. The choice depends on the laboratory's standard operating procedures and the specific assays being performed
*   Action: Follow the laboratory's guidelines for tube selection. Ensure the tubes are within their expiration date
*   **Order of Draw:** Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes
    *   Rationale: To prevent cross-contamination from tube additives. Lipid panels are typically drawn after blood culture tubes and coagulation tubes
    *   Action: Follow CLSI guidelines for the order of draw
*   **Tourniquet Time:** Minimize tourniquet time (ideally less than 1 minute)
    *   Rationale: Prolonged tourniquet time can cause hemoconcentration, leading to falsely elevated lipid levels
      *   Action: Release the tourniquet as soon as blood flow is established, and before the last tube is filled

## **Specimen Processing** {-}
*   **Timing:** Process the specimen as soon as possible after collection
    *   Rationale: To prevent degradation of lipids and cellular metabolism affecting results
    *   Action: Centrifuge the sample within 1-2 hours of collection
*   **Centrifugation:** Centrifuge the sample according to the manufacturer's instructions for the specific tube type
    *   Rationale: Proper centrifugation ensures complete separation of serum or plasma from cells
    *   Action: Use the correct speed and duration for centrifugation
*   **Storage:** If analysis is delayed, store the specimen refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 7 days or frozen (-20°C or -70°C) for longer storage
    *   Rationale: To prevent lipid degradation
    *   Action: Aliquot the sample into smaller portions to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which can degrade lipids

## **Analytical Considerations** {-}
*   **Reagent Quality:** Use high-quality reagents and store them according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Rationale: To ensure accurate and reliable results
    *   Action: Check expiration dates and discard expired reagents
*   **Calibration:** Calibrate the instrument regularly using appropriate standards
    *   Rationale: To ensure accurate and precise measurements
    *   Action: Follow the manufacturer's calibration schedule and procedures
*   **Quality Control (QC):** Run quality control samples at regular intervals to monitor the accuracy and precision of the assay
    *   Rationale: To detect any shifts or trends in the assay performance
    *   Action: Follow the laboratory's QC procedures. Evaluate QC results before releasing patient results

## **Interfering Substances** {-}
*   **Endogenous:** Bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemia
    *   Rationale: These substances can interfere with spectrophotometric assays, leading to inaccurate results
    *   Action: Use methods less susceptible to interference, or employ techniques to remove or correct for the interfering substance
*   **Exogenous:** Medications, contrast dyes
    *   Rationale: Certain medications and contrast dyes can affect lipid levels
    *   Action: Be aware of potential interferences from medications and contrast dyes. Document any such substances the patient has taken


## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **High Lipid Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Patient not fasting
        *   Prolonged tourniquet time
        *   Improper collection tube
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
        *   Interfering substances
*   **Low Lipid Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Improper storage
        *   Lipid degradation
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Check patient preparation
    *   Review collection and processing procedures
    *   Evaluate reagent quality and calibration
    *   Consider interfering substances

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Lipemia**
    *   Interference: Causes turbidity, affecting spectrophotometric readings
    *   Mechanism: Lipids scatter light, leading to inaccurate absorbance measurements
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Use lipemia clearing techniques (ultracentrifugation, lipid clearing reagents)
        *   Consider methods less affected by turbidity
*   **Bilirubin**
    *   Interference: Absorbs light at similar wavelengths, affecting absorbance readings
    *   Mechanism: Competes with the chromogen for light absorption
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Use methods less susceptible to bilirubin interference
        *   Employ bilirubin correction techniques
*   **Hemoglobin**
    *   Interference: Absorbs light and can interfere with enzymatic reactions
    *   Mechanism: Released from hemolyzed red blood cells
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Avoid hemolysis during collection and processing
        *   Use methods less susceptible to hemoglobin interference
*   **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**
    *   Interference: Can interfere with certain enzymatic reactions
    *   Mechanism: Acts as a reducing agent
    *   Mitigation: Use methods less susceptible to ascorbic acid interference
*   **Medications**
    *   Interference: Certain drugs can directly affect lipid levels
    *   Examples:
        *   Statins: Decrease cholesterol
        *   Fibrates: Decrease triglycerides, increase HDL
        *   Beta-blockers: Increase triglycerides, decrease HDL
        *   Oral contraceptives: Increase triglycerides, decrease HDL
    *   Mitigation: Be aware of patient's medication list
