# Result Interpretation {-}

Accurate interpretation of lipid test results is crucial for assessing cardiovascular risk and guiding patient management

*   **Key Analytes**
    *   **Total Cholesterol (TC)**
    *   **Triglycerides (TG)**
    *   **High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C)**
    *   **Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)**
*   **Additional Analytes**
    *   **Non-HDL Cholesterol**
    *   **Apolipoproteins (Apo A-1, Apo B)**
    *   **Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]**

## **Total Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** < 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Desirable: < 200 mg/dL
    *   Borderline High: 200-239 mg/dL (5.18-6.18 mmol/L)
    *   High: ≥ 240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Elevated TC is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
    *   TC is a component of the LDL-C calculation and contributes to overall risk assessment

## **Triglycerides** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** < 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Normal: < 150 mg/dL
    *   Borderline High: 150-199 mg/dL (1.7-2.2 mmol/L)
    *   High: 200-499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L)
    *   Very High: ≥ 500 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Elevated TG is associated with increased risk of CVD, especially in the presence of low HDL-C and other risk factors
    *   Very high TG levels (> 500 mg/dL) increase the risk of pancreatitis
    *   TG is a component of the LDL-C calculation (when using Friedewald equation)

## **High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** > 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L)
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Low: < 40 mg/dL
    *   Optimal: ≥ 60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Low HDL-C is an independent risk factor for CVD
    *   High HDL-C is considered protective against CVD
    *   HDL-C is a component of the LDL-C calculation

## **Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** Varies depending on individual risk factors
*   **Interpretation (ATP III Guidelines)**
    *   Optimal: < 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L)
    *   Near Optimal: 100-129 mg/dL (2.59-3.34 mmol/L)
    *   Borderline High: 130-159 mg/dL (3.37-4.11 mmol/L)
    *   High: 160-189 mg/dL (4.14-4.89 mmol/L)
    *   Very High: ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.91 mmol/L)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   LDL-C is the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy
    *   Lower LDL-C levels are associated with reduced risk of CVD events
    *   LDL-C goals are individualized based on the patient's overall CVD risk

## **Non-HDL Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Calculation:** Non-HDL-C = Total Cholesterol - HDL-C
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Desirable: < 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L)
    *   Borderline High: 130-159 mg/dL (3.37-4.11 mmol/L)
    *   High: 160-189 mg/dL (4.14-4.89 mmol/L)
    *   Very High: ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.91 mmol/L)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Non-HDL-C includes all atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, IDL, Lp(a))
    *   It may be a better predictor of CVD risk than LDL-C alone, especially in patients with high triglycerides

## **Apolipoproteins** {-}

*   **Apo A-1 (Major protein of HDL)**
    *   Reference Interval:
        *   Males: 100-160 mg/dL
        *   Females: 120-190 mg/dL
    *   Clinical Significance:
        *   Low levels are associated with increased CVD risk
*   **Apo B (Major protein of LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a))**
    *   Reference Interval: 80-130 mg/dL
    *   Clinical Significance:
        *   High levels are associated with increased CVD risk
        *   May be a better predictor of CVD risk than LDL-C alone, especially in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes

## **Lipoprotein (a)** {-}

*   **Reference Interval:** < 30 mg/dL or < 75 nmol/L
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Elevated Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for CVD
    *   Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined and less responsive to lifestyle modifications
    *   Consider measuring Lp(a) in patients with premature CVD or a family history of CVD

## **Factors Affecting Interpretation** {-}

*   **Fasting Status:** Triglyceride levels are significantly affected by fasting status. Non-fasting samples can lead to falsely elevated triglyceride levels
*   **Medications:** Certain medications can affect lipid levels (e.g., statins, fibrates, niacin, beta-blockers, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids)
*   **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions can affect lipid levels (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, liver disease, metabolic syndrome)
*   **Acute Illness/Stress:** Acute illness, surgery, or trauma can affect lipid levels
*   **Ethnicity:** Certain ethnic groups may have different lipid levels compared to Caucasians
*   **Age and Gender:** Lipid levels vary with age and gender
*   **Pregnancy:** Pregnancy affects lipid metabolism, and specific reference intervals are used for pregnant women
