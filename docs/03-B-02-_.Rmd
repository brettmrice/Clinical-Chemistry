# Procedures {-}

Reliable lab testing of electrolytes is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and management

## **Analytical Principles** {-}

*   Tests measure electrolyte concentrations in serum, plasma, or whole blood using various methods:
    *   Ion Selective Electrodes (ISEs): Measure the activity of ions
        *   Direct ISE: Uses undiluted sample
        *   Indirect ISE: Requires sample dilution
    *   Spectrophotometry: Measures light absorbance
*   Key Electrolytes
    *   Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Total Carbon Dioxide
    *   Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Iron, TIBC

## **Special Precautions** {-}

*   Patient Preparation
    *   Fasting: For certain analytes
    *   Medications: Review medication list
    *   Hydration Status: Essential to note
*   Specimen Collection
    *   Correct specimen type (serum, plasma, whole blood)
    *   Correct tube type
    *   Adhere to recommended order of draw for multiple tubes
    *   Minimize tourniquet time
    *   Avoid hemolysis
*   Specimen Handling and Processing
    *   Process promptly
    *   Use correct centrifuge settings
    *   Adhere to strict storage temperatures
*   Analytical Considerations
    *   Assure reagent quality
    *   Calibrate instruments correctly
    *   Run Quality Control regularly

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   Unexpected Results
    *   Check for pre-analytical issues
    *   Check analytical steps
    *   Consider interfering substances
    *   Evaluate QC data
    *   Repeat testing if necessary
*   Out-of-Control Quality Control
    *   Check integrity of QC materials
    *   Prepare fresh QC materials
    *   Recalibrate instrument
    *   Review reagent quality

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   Endogenous
    *   Lipemia (turbidity)
    *   Bilirubin (absorbance)
    *   Hemoglobin (releases ions)
    *   Urea (alters enzyme activity)
*   Exogenous
    *   Medications
    *   Contamination

## **Key Takeaways** {-}

*   Proper lab procedures are essential for accurate electrolyte results
*   Know the underlying analytical techniques
*   Understand the factors that affect electrolyte measurements
*   High clinical judgment is recommended when approaching electrolytic results
