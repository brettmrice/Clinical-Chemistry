# Principles {-}

Accurate enzyme testing is vital for diagnosing and monitoring a wide array of diseases. Understanding the principles behind these tests is crucial for accurate lab work

*   **Types of Enzyme Assays**
    *   Kinetic Assays (Continuous Monitoring)
    *   Fixed-Time Assays (Endpoint Assays)
    *   Enzyme Activity vs. Enzyme Concentration

## **Kinetic Assays (Continuous Monitoring)** {-}

*   **Principle:** In kinetic assays, the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is measured continuously over time. The change in absorbance (or other measurable parameter) is monitored as the reaction proceeds
*   **Process**
    1.  **Initiation:** The reaction is initiated by adding the sample containing the enzyme to a solution containing the substrate and any necessary cofactors
    2.  **Monitoring:** The change in absorbance (or other parameter) is monitored continuously over a fixed period (e.g., 1-5 minutes) using a spectrophotometer or other appropriate instrument
    3.  **Calculation:** The rate of the reaction (ΔA/min) is calculated from the slope of the absorbance curve. The enzyme activity is proportional to the reaction rate
*   **Reactions**
    *   Enzyme + Substrate → Product(s)
    *   The rate of product formation (or substrate consumption) is measured directly
*   **Advantages**
    *   More accurate than fixed-time assays, as they account for non-linearity and lag phases
    *   Can detect interferences and substrate depletion
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   More complex instrumentation and data analysis
    *   May be more susceptible to interferences
*   **Examples**
    *   Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): Measures the rate of NADH formation or consumption
    *   Creatine Kinase (CK): Measures the rate of NADPH formation
    *   Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): Measure the rate of NADH formation or consumption
    *   Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT): Measures the rate of p-nitroaniline formation

## **Fixed-Time Assays (Endpoint Assays)** {-}

*   **Principle:** In fixed-time assays, the reaction is allowed to proceed for a fixed period, and the amount of product formed (or substrate consumed) is measured at a single endpoint
*   **Process**
    1.  **Incubation:** The sample containing the enzyme is incubated with the substrate and any necessary cofactors for a fixed period (e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes)
    2.  **Stopping the Reaction:** After the fixed incubation period, the reaction is stopped by adding a reagent that denatures the enzyme or inactivates it
    3.  **Measurement:** The amount of product formed (or substrate consumed) is measured at the endpoint using a spectrophotometer or other appropriate instrument
    4.  **Calculation:** The enzyme activity is proportional to the amount of product formed (or substrate consumed) during the fixed incubation period
*   **Reactions**
    *   Enzyme + Substrate → Product(s)
    *   The amount of product formed is measured at a single time point
*   **Advantages**
    *   Simpler and less expensive than kinetic assays
    *   Easier to automate
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Less accurate than kinetic assays, as they do not account for non-linearity or lag phases
    *   More susceptible to interferences
    *   Can underestimate enzyme activity if the reaction is not linear over the entire incubation period
*   **Examples**
    *   Amylase: Measures the amount of reducing sugars formed from starch hydrolysis
    *   Lipase: Measures the amount of fatty acids released from triglyceride hydrolysis
    *   Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Measures the amount of p-nitrophenol formed from p-nitrophenyl phosphate

## **Enzyme Activity vs. Enzyme Concentration** {-}

*   **Enzyme Activity Assays:** Measure the catalytic activity of the enzyme (i.e., the rate at which it catalyzes a reaction). These assays are used to assess enzyme function and to diagnose conditions involving altered enzyme activity
*   **Enzyme Concentration Assays:** Measure the amount of enzyme protein present in the sample, regardless of its activity. These assays are used to assess enzyme levels and to diagnose conditions involving altered enzyme expression or synthesis
*   **Methods for Measuring Enzyme Concentration**
    *   Immunoassays: Use antibodies specific to the enzyme to capture and quantify the enzyme protein. Examples include ELISA, Western blot, and immunoturbidimetry
    *   Mass Spectrometry: Used to identify and quantify enzyme proteins based on their mass-to-charge ratio
