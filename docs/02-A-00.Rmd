# Enzymes {-}

This section outlines the role of enzymes in diagnostics. Accurate measurement of enzyme activity and its interpretation can provide critical insights into a range of diseases

## **Biochemical Theory and Physiology** {-}

*   **Enzymes as Biological Catalysts:** Accelerate biochemical reactions
*   **Structure and Function:** Active site, cofactors, coenzymes
*   **Enzyme Kinetics:** Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, Vmax, Km
*   **Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity:** pH, temperature, inhibitors, activators
*   **Regulation of Enzyme Activity:** Allosteric regulation, covalent modification
*   **Enzymes in Metabolic Pathways:** Key roles in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, etc
*   **Isoenzymes:** Different forms of the same enzyme with tissue-specific distribution

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Types of Enzyme Assays**
    *   Kinetic Assays (Continuous Monitoring): Measure the rate of reaction
    *   Fixed-Time Assays (Endpoint Assays): Measure product formed after a set time
*   **Commonly Measured Enzymes**
    *   Cardiac Markers: Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB), Troponin
    *   Liver Enzymes: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)
    *   Pancreatic Enzymes: Amylase, Lipase
    *   Muscle Enzymes: Creatine Kinase (CK)
    *   Others: Acid Phosphatase, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)
*   **Special Precautions**
    *   Proper Specimen Collection
    *   Timely Specimen Processing and Handling
    *   Strict Adherence to QC Procedures
*   **Analytical Techniques**
    *   Spectrophotometry
    *   Immunoassay
    *   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   Establish Reference Intervals
*   Elevated Levels: Indicate tissue damage or increased production
*   Isoenzyme Patterns: Aid in identifying the source of the elevated enzymes
*   Clinical Correlation: Integrate lab results with clinical presentation and patient history
*   Factors Affecting Interpretation: Medications, hemolysis, lipemia

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Cardiac Disorders**
    *   Myocardial Infarction: Elevated CK-MB and Troponin
*   **Liver Disorders**
    *   Hepatitis: Elevated ALT and AST
    *   Alcoholic Liver Disease: Elevated AST and GGT
    *   Biliary Obstruction: Elevated ALP and GGT
*   **Pancreatic Disorders**
    *   Pancreatitis: Elevated Amylase and Lipase
*   **Muscle Disorders**
    *   Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK
*   **Other Disorders**
    *   Prostate Cancer: Elevated Acid Phosphatase
    *   Sarcoidosis: Elevated Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)

## **Putting it All Together** {-}

*   Enzyme assays can be affected by a number of things, so accurate collection and running is important
*   Review what factors can influence these tests to get the most accurate and complete clinical picture for the patient
*   Connecting enzyme biochemistry with disease states is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment
