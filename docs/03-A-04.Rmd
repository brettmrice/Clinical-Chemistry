## **Respiratory Acidosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A condition characterized by a decrease in blood pH (< 7.35) due to an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa$CO_2$ > 45 mmHg) resulting from inadequate alveolar ventilation
*   **Underlying Pathophysiology:**
    *   Inadequate alveolar ventilation causes carbon dioxide retention, leading to increased carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$) concentration in the blood
    *   This results in an increase in hydrogen ion ($H^+$) concentration and a decrease in pH
*   **Common Causes**
    *   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Emphysema, chronic bronchitis
    *   Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression: Drug overdose (e.g., opioids, sedatives), brainstem injury
    *   Neuromuscular Disorders: Muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis
    *   Severe Pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Impaired gas exchange
    *   Chest Wall Abnormalities: Kyphoscoliosis, flail chest
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   pH: < 7.35
    *   Pa$CO_2$: > 45 mmHg
    *   $HCO_3^-$: Normal in acute respiratory acidosis; elevated in chronic respiratory acidosis (due to renal compensation)
    *   Pa$O_2$: May be decreased, depending on the underlying cause
*   **Symptoms**
    *   Acute Respiratory Acidosis: Confusion, anxiety, restlessness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), headache, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias
    *   Chronic Respiratory Acidosis: Often asymptomatic or mild symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, and sleep disturbances
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   COPD: Chronic bronchitis and emphysema cause airflow obstruction, leading to carbon dioxide retention
    *   Drug Overdose: Opioids and sedatives depress the respiratory center in the brain, resulting in hypoventilation
    *   Neuromuscular Disorders: Muscle weakness impairs the ability to breathe effectively
    *   Pneumonia and ARDS: Inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs impair gas exchange
    *   Chest Wall Abnormalities: Restrict lung expansion and impair ventilation

## **Respiratory Alkalosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A condition characterized by an increase in blood pH (> 7.45) due to decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa$CO_2$ < 35 mmHg) resulting from excessive alveolar ventilation
*   **Underlying Pathophysiology**
    *   Excessive alveolar ventilation causes carbon dioxide to be blown off, leading to decreased carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$) concentration in the blood
    *   This results in a decrease in hydrogen ion ($H^+$) concentration and an increase in pH
*   **Common Causes**
    *   Hyperventilation Syndrome: Anxiety, panic attacks
    *   Hypoxia: High altitude, severe anemia
    *   Pulmonary Embolism: Stimulation of respiratory centers
    *   Central Nervous System Disorders: Stroke, meningitis, encephalitis
    *   Mechanical Ventilation: Excessive ventilation by a mechanical ventilator
    *   Pregnancy: Hormonal stimulation of the respiratory center
    *   Salicylate Poisoning: Direct stimulation of the respiratory center
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   pH: > 7.45
    *   Pa$CO_2$: < 35 mmHg
    *   $HCO_3^-$: Normal in acute respiratory alkalosis; decreased in chronic respiratory alkalosis (due to renal compensation)
    *   Pa$O_2$: May be normal or decreased, depending on the underlying cause
*   **Symptoms**
    *   Dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, paresthesias (numbness and tingling), muscle cramps, carpopedal spasm (spasm of the hands and feet), chest pain, palpitations

*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Hyperventilation Syndrome: Anxiety and panic attacks cause rapid breathing, leading to excessive carbon dioxide elimination
    *   Hypoxia: Low oxygen levels stimulate the respiratory center to increase ventilation
    *   Pulmonary Embolism: Blood clot in the lungs stimulates respiratory centers, leading to hyperventilation
    *   Pregnancy: Progesterone and other hormones stimulate the respiratory center

## **Metabolic Acidosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A condition characterized by a decrease in blood pH (< 7.35) due to a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration ($HCO_3^-$ < 22 mEq/L)
*   **Underlying Pathophysiology**

        *   Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin deficiency leads to increased ketone production
        *   Lactic Acidosis: Anaerobic metabolism due to shock, sepsis, or severe exercise
        *   Starvation: Breakdown of fats and proteins leads to increased ketoacid production

*   **Anion Gap**
    *   Definition: The difference between measured cations (Na+, $K^+$) and anions (Cl-, $HCO_3^-$) in serum or plasma
    *   Calculation: Anion Gap = [$Na^+$] + [$K^+$] - [$Cl^-$] - [$HCO_3^-$]
    *   Normal Anion Gap: 8-16 mEq/L (with $K^+$), 10-20 mEq/L (without $K^+$)
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin deficiency leads to increased ketone production, resulting in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis
    *   Lactic Acidosis: Anaerobic metabolism due to shock, sepsis, or severe exercise results in increased lactic acid production, leading to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis
    *   Diarrhea: Loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal secretions results in a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis

*   **Underlying Pathophysiology**
    *   Excess alkali administration: Overwhelms the body's acid-base regulatory mechanisms
    *   Excess loss of acid: Depletes the body's acid stores, leading to a relative excess of bicarbonate
    *   Contraction alkalosis: Volume contraction stimulates bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys
*   **Common Causes**
