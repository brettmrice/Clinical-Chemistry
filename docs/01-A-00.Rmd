# Carbohydrates {-}

This overview connects the biochemical understanding of carbohydrates with their clinical assessment in the laboratory

## **Biochemical Theory and Physiology** {-}

*   **Carbohydrates as Fuel:** Carbohydrates, primarily glucose, are our main energy source
*   **Metabolic Pathways**
    *   **Glycolysis:** Glucose breakdown for energy
    *   **Gluconeogenesis:** Glucose synthesis from non-carb sources
    *   **Glycogenesis:** Glucose storage as glycogen
    *   **Glycogenolysis:** Glycogen breakdown to release glucose
    *   **Pentose Phosphate Pathway:** NADPH and nucleotide precursor production
*   **Hormonal Control:** Insulin (lowers glucose) and glucagon (raises glucose) are key regulators
*   **Normal State:** Tight blood glucose control for consistent energy, especially for the brain
*   **Abnormal States:** Hyper/hypoglycemia, insulin resistance, and genetic metabolic disorders

## **Laboratory Test Procedures** {-}

*   **Glucose Measurement**
    *   **Principle:** Enzymatic methods like glucose oxidase or hexokinase
    *   Specimen is plasma, serum, or whole blood
*   **Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)**
    *   **Principle:** Assesses glucose clearance after a glucose load
    *   Serial glucose measurements at timed intervals
*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)**
    *   **Principle:** Measures average glucose over 2-3 months
    *   Immunoassay or HPLC methods
    *   Whole blood specimen
*   **Urine Glucose**
    *   **Principle:** Detects glucose in urine
    *   Dipstick or enzymatic methods
*   **Ketone Measurement**
    *   **Principle:** Detects ketones in blood/urine, indicating fat breakdown
    *   Immunoassay or enzymatic methods
*   **Specialized Testing:** For galactose, fructose, etc., using enzymatic or chromatographic methods

## **Test Result Interpretation** {-}

*   **Normoglycemia:** Fasting 70-99 mg/dL, postprandial < 140 mg/dL
*   **Diabetes Diagnosis**
    *   Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL
    *   2-hour GTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL
    *   HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
    *   Random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms
*   **Prediabetes**
    *   Impaired fasting glucose: 100-125 mg/dL
    *   Impaired glucose tolerance: 2-hour GTT 140-199 mg/dL
    *   HbA1c 5.7-6.4%
*   **Gestational Diabetes:** Specific OGTT criteria
*   **Hypoglycemia:** Glucose < 70 mg/dL
*   **Ketones:** Positive indicates fat breakdown, as in DKA

## **Disease State Correlation** {-}

*   **Diabetes Mellitus:** Hyperglycemia due to insulin issues
*   **Prediabetes:** Increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
*   **Gestational Diabetes:** Diabetes during pregnancy, risks for mother/baby
*   **Hypoglycemia:** Low glucose, various causes
*   **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):** Hyperglycemia, ketosis, acidosis (life-threatening)
*   **Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS):** Extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration
*   **Genetic Disorders:** Galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, etc

## **Putting It Together** {-}

*   **Comprehensive Picture:** Lab results + clinical context + patient history
*   **Clinical Significance:** Guiding diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of metabolic disorders
*   **Continual Learning:** Staying updated on new guidelines and testing methods is key
