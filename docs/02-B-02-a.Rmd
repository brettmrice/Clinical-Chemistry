# Principles {-}

Labs perform many tests to assess protein status and nitrogen balance. Understanding the principles is key to accurate testing

*   Total Protein
*   Albumin
*   Prealbumin (Transthyretin)
*   Globulins
*   Urea (Blood Urea Nitrogen - BUN)
*   Creatinine
*   Uric Acid
*   Ammonia
*   Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Protein
*   Urine Protein
*   Protein Electrophoresis (Serum and Urine)
*   Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE)
*   Tumor Markers (PSA, AFP, CEA, CA-125, etc.)

## **Total Protein** {-}

*   **Principle:** The Biuret Reaction is the basis for most total protein assays. In an alkaline solution, peptide bonds react with copper(II) ions (Cu2+) to form a colored complex. The intensity of the colored complex is directly proportional to the number of peptide bonds, and therefore the protein concentration, in the sample
*   **Reactions**
    *   Peptide Bonds + Cu2+ (in Alkaline Solution) → Colored Complex
*   **Components of the Biuret Reagent**
    *   Copper(II) Sulfate (CuSO4): Provides the Cu2+ ions
    *   Sodium Potassium Tartrate: Chelates the Cu2+ ions to prevent precipitation
    *   Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH): Provides the alkaline environment
    *   Potassium Iodide (KI): Prevents reduction of Cu2+
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored complex is measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength between 540-560 nm
*   **Advantages:** Simple, widely available, and relatively inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from lipemia, hemolysis, and icterus

## **Albumin** {-}

*   **Principle:** Dye-binding methods are commonly used. Albumin binds to a dye (e.g., bromcresol green or bromcresol purple) at a specific pH, causing a change in the dye's absorbance. The change in absorbance is directly proportional to the albumin concentration
*   **Dyes Used**
    *   Bromcresol Green (BCG): At a pH of 4.2, BCG binds to albumin, causing a color change
    *   Bromcresol Purple (BCP): At a pH of 5.2, BCP binds to albumin, causing a color change
*   **Reactions**
    *   Albumin + Dye → Albumin-Dye Complex (Colored)
*   **Detection:** The absorbance of the Albumin-Dye Complex is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** Simple, rapid, and automated
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from certain medications and elevated bilirubin levels

## **Prealbumin (Transthyretin)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Immunochemical methods (e.g., nephelometry, turbidimetry) are used to measure prealbumin. Antibodies specific to prealbumin are used to capture and quantify prealbumin in a blood sample
*   **Methods**
    *   Nephelometry
    *   Turbidimetry
*   **Reactions**
    *   Prealbumin + Prealbumin-Specific Antibody → Antibody-Prealbumin Complex
*   **Detection:** The amount of antibody-prealbumin complex formed is measured, and is proportional to the prealbumin concentration
*   **Advantages:** Specific and automated
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be affected by interfering substances and requires specialized equipment

## **Globulins** {-}

*   **Principle:** Globulins are typically not measured directly, but are calculated by subtracting albumin from total protein
    *   Globulins = Total Protein - Albumin

## **Urea (Blood Urea Nitrogen - BUN)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Several methods are available for measuring BUN. Two common methods are the enzymatic method and the direct chemical method
*   **Enzymatic Method (Urease Method)**

    *   Reactions
        *   Urea + H2O --(Urease)--> 2 NH3 + CO2
        *   NH3 + Reagent → Colored Product
*   **Direct Chemical Method (Diacetyl Monoxime Method)**
    *   Urea reacts with diacetyl monoxime in the presence of acid and a catalyst to form a colored product
    *   Reactions
        *   Urea + Diacetyl Monoxime → Colored Product
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** Both methods are widely available and relatively inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from ammonia and other nitrogen-containing compounds

## **Creatinine** {-}

*   **Principle:** The Jaffe Reaction is commonly used. Creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline solution to form a colored Janovski complex. The rate of color formation is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions**
    *   Creatinine + Picric Acid (in Alkaline Solution) → Janovski Complex (Colored)
*   **Methods**
    *   Kinetic Jaffe Method: Measures the rate of color formation, reducing interferences
    *   Compensated Jaffe Method: Uses a blank to correct for interferences
    *   Enzymatic Methods: Use enzymes to convert creatinine to measurable products
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored complex is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** Simple and widely available
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from bilirubin, glucose, and certain medications

## **Uric Acid** {-}

*   **Principle:** Several methods are available for measuring uric acid. Two common methods are the enzymatic method and the chemical method

    *   Reactions
        *   Uric Acid + O2 + H2O --(Uricase)--> Allantoin + H2O2 + CO2
    *   Coupled enzyme reactions can be used to quantify the H2O2 produced
*   **Chemical Method (Phosphotungstic Acid Method)**
    *   Uric acid reduces phosphotungstic acid to tungsten blue in an alkaline solution
    *   Reactions
        *   Uric Acid + Phosphotungstic Acid → Tungsten Blue
*   **Detection:** The decrease in absorbance at 290 nm (enzymatic method) or the intensity of the tungsten blue (chemical method) is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** The enzymatic method is more specific and less susceptible to interferences
*   **Disadvantages:** The chemical method is less expensive but more susceptible to interferences

## **Ammonia** {-}

*   **Methods**
    *   Enzymatic Method: Ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutarate and NADPH in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to form glutamate and NADP+. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is measured
    *   Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) Method: Ammonia is measured using an ion-selective electrode
*   **Reactions**
    *   NH4+ + α-Ketoglutarate + NADPH --(GLDH)--> Glutamate + NADP+ + H2O
*   **Detection:** The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (enzymatic method) is measured spectrophotometrically or the potential difference is measured (ISE)
*   **Advantages:** The enzymatic method is more sensitive and specific
*   **Disadvantages:** Ammonia is volatile and can be easily contaminated

## **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Protein** {-}

*   **Principle:** Similar to total protein methods, the Biuret Reaction or dye-binding methods (e.g., Coomassie Brilliant Blue) are used to measure total protein in CSF

    *   CSF protein levels are much lower than serum protein levels, requiring more sensitive methods
    *   Samples should be free of blood contamination

*   **Principle:** Several methods are available for measuring urine protein. Two common methods are the turbidimetric method and the dye-binding method
*   **Turbidimetric Method**

    *   Reactions
        *   Protein + Precipitating Reagent → Turbidity
*   **Dye-Binding Method**
    *   Similar to serum albumin methods, protein binds to a dye (e.g., Coomassie Brilliant Blue) causing a change in absorbance
    *   Reactions
        *   Protein + Dye → Protein-Dye Complex (Colored)
*   **Detection:** The turbidity or the intensity of the colored complex is measured spectrophotometrically
