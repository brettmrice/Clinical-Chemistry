# Principles {-}

Lipid testing in the lab helps to assess cardiovascular risk, diagnose lipid disorders, and monitor treatment

*   **Core Lipid Tests**
    *   **Total Cholesterol:** Measures all cholesterol in the blood
    *   **Triglycerides:** Measures the amount of triglycerides in the blood
    *   **HDL Cholesterol:** Measures high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
    *   **LDL Cholesterol:** Measures low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
    *   **Apolipoproteins:** Measures specific apolipoproteins associated with lipoproteins

## **Total Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Principle:** Enzymatic methods are commonly used. Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes cholesterol esters to free cholesterol. Cholesterol oxidase then oxidizes free cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is then reacted with a chromogen in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a colored product, which is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Cholesterol Esters --(Cholesterol Esterase)--> Cholesterol + Fatty Acids
    2.  Cholesterol + O2 --(Cholesterol Oxidase)--> Cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2
    3.  2 H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + 2 H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is directly proportional to the total cholesterol concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Accurate, precise, and widely available
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be affected by interfering substances such as bilirubin and hemoglobin

## **Triglycerides** {-}

*   **Principle:** Enzymatic methods are used. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides to glycerol and free fatty acids. Glycerol is then phosphorylated by glycerol kinase (GK) to glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P). G-3-P is oxidized by glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP) and H2O2. H2O2 is then reacted with a chromogen in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a colored product, which is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions**
    1.  Triglycerides --(Lipoprotein Lipase)--> Glycerol + 3 Fatty Acids
    2.  Glycerol + ATP --(Glycerol Kinase)--> Glycerol-3-Phosphate + ADP
    3.  Glycerol-3-Phosphate + O2 --(Glycerol-3-Phosphate Oxidase)--> Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate + H2O2
    4.  2 H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + 2 H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is directly proportional to the triglycerides concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Accurate, precise, and widely available
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be affected by interfering substances such as bilirubin and lipemia

## **HDL Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   **Direct Methods:** Use selective detergents or antibodies to block non-HDL lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, chylomicrons), leaving only HDL to be measured. The HDL cholesterol is then measured using a cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase method similar to that used for total cholesterol
    *   **Indirect Methods:** Use precipitation reagents to selectively precipitate non-HDL lipoproteins, followed by measurement of cholesterol in the supernatant containing only HDL
*   **Reactions**
    *   **Direct Methods**
        1.  Selective Detergents/Antibodies block non-HDL lipoproteins
        2.  HDL Cholesterol + O2 --(Cholesterol Oxidase)--> Cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2
        3.  2 H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + 2 H2O
    *   **Indirect Methods**
        1.  Non-HDL lipoproteins are precipitated
        2.  HDL Cholesterol + O2 --(Cholesterol Oxidase)--> Cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2
        3.  2 H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + 2 H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is directly proportional to the HDL cholesterol concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages**
    *   Direct methods are automated and less susceptible to interferences
    *   Indirect methods are inexpensive but more labor-intensive
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Indirect methods can be affected by incomplete precipitation or carryover of non-HDL lipoproteins
    *   Direct methods can be affected by certain interfering substances

## **LDL Cholesterol** {-}

*   **Principle**
    *   **Friedewald Equation (Calculation):** LDL cholesterol is estimated using the Friedewald equation:
    *   LDL Cholesterol = Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - (Triglycerides / 5) (all in mg/dL)
    *   LDL Cholesterol = Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - (Triglycerides / 2.2) (all in mmol/L)
    *   This equation is valid only when triglycerides are < 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L)
    *   **Direct Methods:** Use selective detergents or antibodies to block non-LDL lipoproteins (HDL, VLDL, chylomicrons), leaving only LDL to be measured. The LDL cholesterol is then measured using a cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase method similar to that used for total cholesterol
*   **Reactions**
    *   **Direct Methods**
        1.  Selective Detergents/Antibodies block non-LDL lipoproteins
        2.  LDL Cholesterol + O2 --(Cholesterol Oxidase)--> Cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2
        3.  2 H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + 2 H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product (for direct methods) is directly proportional to the LDL cholesterol concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages**
    *   Friedewald equation is inexpensive and widely used
    *   Direct methods are more accurate and can be used when triglycerides are elevated
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Friedewald equation is not accurate when triglycerides are > 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) or in certain dyslipidemia
    *   Direct methods are more expensive

## **Apolipoproteins** {-}

*   **Principle:** Immunochemical methods are commonly used to measure specific apolipoproteins. Antibodies specific to the apolipoprotein are used to capture and quantify the apolipoprotein in a blood sample
*   **Methods**
    *   **Turbidimetric Immunoassay (TIA):** Antibody-apolipoprotein complex formation is measured by the change in turbidity (light scattering)
    *   **Nephelometry:** Antibody-apolipoprotein complex formation is measured by the amount of light scattered at an angle
    *   **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):** Enzyme-labeled antibodies are used, and the enzyme activity is measured to quantify the antibody-apolipoprotein complex
*   **Detection:** The amount of antibody-apolipoprotein complex formed is measured, and is proportional to the apolipoprotein concentration
*   **Advantages:** Specific and automated
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be affected by interfering substances and requires specialized equipment

*   **Principle:** Separates lipoproteins based on their electrical charge and size
*   **Procedure**
    *   Serum is applied to a support medium (e.g., agarose gel or paper)
    *   An electric field is applied, causing lipoproteins to migrate at different rates
    *   Lipoproteins are stained with a lipid-specific dye
