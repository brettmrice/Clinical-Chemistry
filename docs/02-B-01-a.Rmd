## **Protein Synthesis** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To produce proteins from amino acids, based on the genetic code
*   **Location:** Ribosomes in the cytoplasm
*   **Process**
    1.  **Transcription:** DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus
    2.  **Translation:** mRNA is translated into a protein on ribosomes in the cytoplasm
        *   mRNA binds to ribosomes
        *   tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome
        *   Amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain
    3.  **Post-Translational Modification:** The polypeptide chain is modified to form a functional protein
        *   Folding: The polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional structure
        *   Modification: Chemical groups may be added or removed (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation)
        *   Cleavage: The polypeptide chain may be cleaved into smaller fragments
        *   Quaternary Structure: Multiple polypeptide chains may assemble to form a complex protein
*   **Regulation**
    *   Transcription Factors: Regulate the transcription of genes
    *   mRNA Stability: Affects the amount of protein produced
    *   Ribosome Availability: Affects the rate of translation
    *   Post-Translational Modification: Can activate or inactivate proteins

## **Protein Degradation** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To break down proteins into amino acids
*   **Location:** Lysosomes and proteasomes
*   **Process**
    1.  **Lysosomal Degradation**
        *   Proteins are taken up by lysosomes
        *   Lysosomes contain proteases that degrade proteins into amino acids
    2.  **Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway**
        *   Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin
        *   Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by proteasomes into small peptides
        *   Peptides are further degraded into amino acids
*   **Regulation**
    *   Ubiquitin Ligases: Regulate the ubiquitination of proteins
    *   Proteasome Activity: Regulated by ATP and other factors

## **Amino Acid Metabolism** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To convert amino acids into other molecules, including energy, glucose, lipids, and specialized products
*   **Transamination**
    *   Transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to a keto acid
    *   Catalyzed by aminotransferases (transaminases)
    *   Requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor
    *   Important for synthesizing non-essential amino acids
*   **Deamination**
    *   Removal of an amino group from an amino acid
    *   Produces ammonia (NH3)
    *   Ammonia is toxic and must be converted to urea for excretion
*   **Urea Cycle**
    *   Conversion of ammonia to urea
    *   Occurs in the liver
    *   Involves a series of enzymatic reactions
    *   Urea is excreted in the urine
*   **Synthesis of Specialized Products**
    *   Amino acids are used to synthesize a variety of specialized products, including:
        *   Neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine)
        *   Hormones (e.g., thyroid hormones)
        *   Purines and Pyrimidines (building blocks of DNA and RNA)
        *   Porphyrins (e.g., heme)
        *   Creatine
*   **Regulation**
    *   Hormonal Control: Insulin, glucagon, and cortisol regulate amino acid metabolism
    *   Allosteric Regulation: Enzymes in amino acid metabolic pathways are regulated by allosteric effectors
    *   Substrate Availability: The availability of amino acids affects the rate of metabolism

## **Creatine Metabolism** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To synthesize creatine and phosphocreatine, which are important for energy storage in muscle cells
*   **Process**
    1.  **Synthesis of Creatine**
        *   Arginine + Glycine → Guanidinoacetate + Ornithine (in kidney)
        *   Guanidinoacetate + SAM → Creatine + SAH (in liver)
    2.  **Transport to Muscle**
        *   Creatine is transported from the liver to muscle cells
    3.  **Phosphorylation of Creatine**
        *   Creatine + ATP ↔ Phosphocreatine + ADP (catalyzed by creatine kinase)
    4.  **Use of Phosphocreatine**
        *   Phosphocreatine is used to regenerate ATP during muscle contraction
    5.  **Degradation of Creatine and Phosphocreatine**
        *   Creatine and phosphocreatine are spontaneously converted to creatinine
        *   Creatinine is excreted in the urine
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Creatine kinase (CK) is used as a marker of muscle damage
    *   Creatinine is used as a measure of kidney function
