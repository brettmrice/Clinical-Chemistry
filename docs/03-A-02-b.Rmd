# Precautions {-}

Accurate blood gas analysis requires careful technique and attention to detail to ensure reliable results. This includes proper handling from collection to troubleshooting

*   Specimen Collection
*   Specimen Handling and Processing
*   Calibration and Quality Control
*   Interfering Substances
*   Troubleshooting

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Steady State: Ensure the patient is in a steady state for at least 20-30 minutes before collection. Avoid recent changes in oxygen therapy or ventilation settings
    *   Supplemental Oxygen: Document the amount of supplemental oxygen the patient is receiving (e.g., Fi$O_2$, flow rate)
    *   Anticoagulant Therapy: Be aware of patients on anticoagulant therapy, as this increases the risk of bleeding
*   **Arterial vs. Venous Samples**
    *   Arterial samples are preferred for acid-base assessment and oxygenation status
    *   Venous samples can be used for pH and carbon dioxide measurements, but oxygen levels will not be accurate
*   **Site Selection**
    *   Radial Artery: Most common site due to accessibility and collateral circulation
    *   Brachial Artery: Larger and easier to access, but higher risk of complications
    *   Femoral Artery: Used in emergency situations, but highest risk of complications
*   **Technique**
    *   Modified Allen Test: Perform a modified Allen test before radial artery puncture to assess collateral circulation
    *   Proper Angle: Insert the needle at a 30-45 degree angle for radial artery puncture
    *   Avoid Air Bubbles: Prevent air bubbles from entering the syringe, as this can affect gas measurements
*   **Syringe Type**
    *   Use a pre-heparinized syringe designed for blood gas collection
    *   Avoid using excessive heparin, as this can alter pH and electrolyte measurements
    *   If using a dry heparin syringe, ensure the heparin is evenly distributed
*   **Mixing**
    *   Immediately after collection, gently mix the sample by rolling the syringe to ensure adequate anticoagulation

## **Specimen Handling and Processing** {-}

*   **Timing**
    *   Analyze the sample as soon as possible after collection (ideally within 15-30 minutes) to minimize changes in pH and gas levels due to cellular metabolism
*   **Storage**
    *   If analysis is delayed, store the sample on ice to slow down cellular metabolism
    *   Samples should be analyzed within 1-2 hours of collection, even when stored on ice
*   **Air Exposure**
    *   Prevent air exposure, as this can affect Pa$O_2$ and Pa$CO_2$ measurements
    *   If air bubbles are present, remove them immediately and mix the sample again
*   **Clotting**
    *   Inspect the sample for clots. If clots are present, reject the sample
*   **Transportation**
    *   Transport the sample to the laboratory in a timely manner, using appropriate temperature control (ice)

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Air Contamination**
    *   Falsely elevates Pa$O_2$ and decreases Pa$CO_2$
    *   Prevent by carefully expelling air bubbles from the syringe
*   **Excess Heparin**
    *   Can lower pH
    *   Use pre-heparinized syringes or minimize the amount of heparin used
*   **Metabolic Activity**
    *   Continued metabolism in the sample consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, leading to decreased Pa$O_2$ and increased Pa$CO_2$
    *   Analyze samples promptly or store on ice to slow metabolism
*   **Temperature**
    *   Temperature affects gas solubility and electrode function
    *   Ensure the blood gas analyzer is temperature controlled
*   **High Bilirubin or Lipids**
    *   Can interfere with some electrode measurements
    *   Use methods less susceptible to interference or employ techniques to remove the interfering substance
*   **Calibration Errors**
    *   Improper calibration can lead to inaccurate results
    *   Follow the manufacturer's calibration procedures and use certified reference materials

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Unexpected Results**
    *   Check patient preparation
    *   Review collection and processing procedures
    *   Evaluate reagent quality and calibration
    *   Consider interfering substances
    *   Repeat the test using a new sample
*   **Out-of-Control QC**
    *   Check the integrity of the QC materials
    *   Prepare fresh QC materials
    *   Re-calibrate the instrument
    *   Review reagent quality
    *   Repeat the QC testing
    *   If the problem persists, contact the instrument manufacturer for assistance
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Check electrode performance, replace it as needed
    *   Perform maintenance as instructed by the manufacturer
    *   Verify proper instrument configuration
