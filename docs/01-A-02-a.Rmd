## **Glucose Measurement** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** Accurate measurement of glucose is central to diagnosing and managing diabetes mellitus

### **Glucose Oxidase Method (GOD)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2 is then reacted with a chromogen in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a colored product, which is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions:**
    *   Glucose + O2 + H2O --(Glucose Oxidase)--> Gluconic Acid + H2O2
    *   H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is directly proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Specific for glucose, relatively inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interference from reducing substances, oxygen availability can affect results

### **Hexokinase Method (HK)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose by ATP to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and ADP. G6P is then oxidized by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the presence of NAD+ to form 6-phosphogluconate and NADH. The NADH produced is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reactions:**
    *   Glucose + ATP --(Hexokinase)--> Glucose-6-Phosphate + ADP
    *   Glucose-6-Phosphate + NAD+ --(G6PD)--> 6-Phosphogluconate + NADH + H+
*   **Detection:** The increase in absorbance due to NADH formation is directly proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** More accurate and precise than glucose oxidase, less susceptible to interferences
*   **Disadvantages:** More expensive than glucose oxidase, requires additional enzymes

## **Glucose Tolerance Testing (GTT)** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** GTT assesses the body's response to a glucose challenge, providing insight into insulin secretion and sensitivity

### **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)** {-}

*   **Principle:** A measured dose of glucose is administered orally, and blood glucose levels are measured at specific intervals (e.g., 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes) to assess how the body processes glucose
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Patient Preparation: Overnight fasting (8-12 hours)
    *   Glucose Load: Adults typically receive 75 grams of glucose in a liquid solution. Pregnant women may receive a different dose (e.g., 50g for gestational diabetes screening, 100g for diagnostic testing). Children receive 1.75 g of glucose per kg of body weight, up to a maximum of 75 g
    *   Blood Collection: Blood samples are collected at timed intervals (e.g., fasting, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours)
*   **Detection:** Plasma or serum glucose concentrations are measured at each time point using enzymatic methods (glucose oxidase or hexokinase)
*   **Interpretation:** Glucose levels are plotted against time to generate a glucose tolerance curve. The shape of the curve and the glucose values at different time points are used to diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes
*   **Clinical Significance:** OGTT is used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes (during pregnancy), and to assess insulin resistance

## **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** HbA1c reflects long-term glycemic control, providing an integrated measure of average blood glucose levels over several weeks

### **Immunoassay Methods** {-}

*   **Principle:** Antibodies specific to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are used to capture and quantify HbA1c in a blood sample
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Sample Preparation: Whole blood is lysed to release hemoglobin
    *   Incubation: The sample is incubated with HbA1c-specific antibodies
    *   Detection: The amount of antibody-HbA1c complex formed is measured, and is proportional to the HbA1c concentration
*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):** Enzyme-labeled antibodies are used, and the enzyme activity is measured to quantify the antibody-HbA1c complex
    *   **Turbidimetric Inhibition Immunoassay (TINIA):** Antibody-HbA1c complex formation is measured by the change in turbidity (light scattering)
*   **Advantages:** Automated, high-throughput, widely available
*   **Disadvantages:** Susceptible to interferences from hemoglobin variants and other factors affecting red blood cell turnover

### **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)** {-}

*   **Principle:** HPLC separates different hemoglobin fractions (including HbA1c) based on their chemical properties. The separated fractions are then quantified using spectrophotometric detection
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Sample Preparation: Whole blood is lysed to release hemoglobin
    *   Separation: The hemolysate is injected into an HPLC column that separates hemoglobin fractions based on charge or affinity
    *   Detection: HbA1c and other hemoglobin fractions are detected by measuring their absorbance at a specific wavelength
*   **Advantages:** Highly accurate, can detect hemoglobin variants
*   **Disadvantages:** More complex, requires specialized equipment, more labor-intensive than immunoassay methods

## **Urine Glucose** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** Urine glucose is a quick indicator of hyperglycemia but is less sensitive than blood glucose measurements

### **Dipstick Method** {-}

*   **Principle:** A reagent strip impregnated with glucose oxidase, peroxidase, and a chromogen is dipped into the urine sample. Glucose in the urine reacts with glucose oxidase to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide then reacts with the chromogen in the presence of peroxidase to produce a colored product
*   **Reactions:** Same as Glucose Oxidase Method
*   **Detection:** The color change on the reagent strip is compared to a color chart to estimate the glucose concentration in the urine
*   **Advantages:** Simple, rapid, inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Semi-quantitative, less sensitive than blood glucose measurements, susceptible to interferences from reducing substances and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)

### **Enzymatic Methods** {-}

*   **Principle:** Similar to enzymatic methods used for blood glucose measurement (glucose oxidase or hexokinase). The reaction products are measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Advantages:** More quantitative than dipstick method, more sensitive
*   **Disadvantages:** More complex, requires instrumentation

## **Ketone Measurement** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** Ketone testing helps detect ketoacidosis, a serious complication of uncontrolled diabetes

### **Nitroprusside Reaction (Ketostix)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Acetoacetate and acetone react with nitroprusside in an alkaline medium to produce a purple color
*   **Procedure:** A reagent strip impregnated with sodium nitroprusside, glycine, and a buffer is dipped into the urine or serum sample
*   **Detection:** The color change on the reagent strip is compared to a color chart to estimate the ketone concentration
*   **Specificity:** Primarily detects acetoacetate; acetone reacts less strongly. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is not detected
*   **Advantages:** Simple, rapid, inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages:** Semi-quantitative, does not detect beta-hydroxybutyrate (the predominant ketone body in DKA), susceptible to false positives

### **Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) Measurement** {-}

*   **Principle:** Beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BHBDH) catalyzes the oxidation of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The NADH produced is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Reaction:**
    *   Beta-Hydroxybutyrate + NAD+ --(BHBDH)--> Acetoacetate + NADH + H+
*   **Detection:** The increase in absorbance due to NADH formation is directly proportional to the beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration in the sample
*   **Advantages:** Quantitative, specific for beta-hydroxybutyrate, clinically more relevant in DKA management
*   **Disadvantages:** More expensive, requires instrumentation

## **Other Carbohydrates** {-}

*   **Core Concept:** While glucose is the primary focus, specific tests exist for other sugars when investigating metabolic disorders

### **Galactose Measurement** {-}

*   **Principle:** Galactose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of galactose to galactonolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then reacted with a chromogen in the presence of peroxidase to produce a colored product
*   **Reaction:**
    *   Galactose + O2 + H2O --(Galactose Oxidase)--> Galactonolactone + H2O2
    *   H2O2 + Chromogen --(Peroxidase)--> Oxidized Chromogen (Colored) + H2O
*   **Detection:** The intensity of the colored product is directly proportional to the galactose concentration in the sample
*   **Clinical Significance:** Used to diagnose and monitor galactosemia

### **Fructose Measurement** {-}
