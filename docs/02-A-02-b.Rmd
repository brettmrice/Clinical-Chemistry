# Special Precautions {-}

Accurate enzyme testing relies on strict attention to detail throughout the entire process, from the patient to the instrument. This section outlines the key considerations for reliable enzyme measurements

*   Specimen Collection
*   Specimen Handling and Processing
*   Analytical Considerations
*   Interfering Substances
*   Troubleshooting

## **Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Patient Preparation**
    *   Fasting: Some enzyme tests require fasting (e.g., lipase) to minimize the effects of lipemia. Follow specific guidelines for each test
    *   Medications: Certain medications can affect enzyme levels. The healthcare provider should review the patient's medication list and determine if any medications need to be temporarily discontinued before testing
    *   Recent Procedures: Recent surgeries, injections, or other medical procedures can affect enzyme levels. Defer testing until the patient has recovered
    *   Exercise: Strenuous exercise can elevate muscle enzymes (e.g., CK). Avoid strenuous exercise prior to blood collection
*   **Specimen Type**
    *   Serum is the most common specimen type for enzyme assays
    *   Plasma may be used for some enzyme assays, but follow the laboratory's guidelines for anticoagulant selection
*   **Tube Type**
    *   Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes are commonly used for serum collection
    *   Plasma tubes with heparin or EDTA may be used for some assays, but follow the laboratory's guidelines
*   **Order of Draw**
    *   Follow the correct order of draw when collecting multiple tubes to prevent cross-contamination
*   **Tourniquet Time**
    *   Minimize tourniquet time (ideally less than 1 minute) to prevent hemoconcentration
*   **Collection Technique**
    *   Use a clean venipuncture technique to minimize hemolysis. Avoid prolonged probing or excessive force

## **Specimen Handling and Processing** {-}

*   **Timing**
    *   Process the specimen as soon as possible after collection to prevent enzyme degradation
    *   Analyze unstable enzymes (e.g., CK-MB) within a short time frame
*   **Centrifugation**
    *   Centrifuge the sample according to the manufacturer's instructions for the specific tube type
    *   Proper centrifugation ensures complete separation of serum or plasma from cells
*   **Storage**
    *   If analysis is delayed, store the specimen refrigerated (2-8°C) for short-term storage or frozen (-20°C or -70°C) for longer storage
    *   Aliquot the sample into smaller portions to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which can degrade enzymes
*   **Hemolysis**
    *   Avoid hemolysis, as red blood cells contain high concentrations of many enzymes (e.g., LDH, AST), which can falsely elevate results
    *   Visually inspect the sample for hemolysis and reject hemolyzed samples

## **Analytical Considerations** {-}

*   **Reagent Quality**
    *   Use high-quality reagents and store them according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Check expiration dates and discard expired reagents
*   **Calibration**
    *   Calibrate the instrument regularly using appropriate standards
    *   Use multiple calibrators to ensure linearity over the entire measurement range
*   **Quality Control (QC)**
    *   Run quality control samples at regular intervals to monitor the accuracy and precision of the assay
    *   Use both normal and abnormal QC levels to assess performance across the entire range
    *   Evaluate QC results before releasing patient results
*   **Instrumentation**
    *   Regularly maintain and service the instrument according to the manufacturer's recommendations
    *   Ensure the instrument is functioning properly and that all components are in good working order
*   **Method Validation**
    *   Validate new methods before implementation to ensure accuracy, precision, linearity, and other performance characteristics

## **Interfering Substances** {-}

*   **Endogenous**
    *   Lipemia: Causes turbidity, affecting spectrophotometric readings
    *   Bilirubin: Absorbs light at similar wavelengths, affecting absorbance readings
    *   Hemoglobin: Released from hemolyzed red blood cells, interfering with enzymatic reactions
    *   Urea: High concentrations can interfere with some enzymatic reactions
    *   High Protein Concentrations: Can interfere with enzymatic assays by affecting the reaction kinetics or detection system
*   **Exogenous**
    *   Medications: Certain drugs can directly affect enzyme levels
    *   Anticoagulants: Some anticoagulants can interfere with enzymatic reactions
    *   Contaminants: Improperly cleaned glassware or containers can introduce contaminants that affect enzyme activity
*   **Minimizing Interferences**
    *   Use methods less susceptible to interference
    *   Employ techniques to remove or correct for the interfering substance
    *   Dilute the sample to reduce the concentration of the interfering substance
    *   Use appropriate blanking or background subtraction techniques

## **Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Unexpectedly High Enzyme Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Patient not fasting
        *   Prolonged tourniquet time
        *   Hemolysis
        *   Improper collection tube
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
        *   Interfering substances
        *   Instrument malfunction
*   **Unexpectedly Low Enzyme Results**
    *   Pre-Analytical:
        *   Improper storage
        *   Enzyme degradation
    *   Analytical:
        *   Incorrect calibration
        *   Reagent deterioration
        *   Instrument malfunction
*   **Inconsistent Results**
    *   Check patient preparation
    *   Review collection and processing procedures
    *   Evaluate reagent quality and calibration
    *   Consider interfering substances
    *   Repeat the test using a different method or on a new sample
*   **Out-of-Control QC Results**
    *   Check the integrity of the QC materials
    *   Prepare fresh QC materials
    *   Re-calibrate the instrument
    *   Review reagent quality
    *   Repeat the QC testing
    *   If the problem persists, contact the instrument manufacturer for assistance

## **Examples** {-}

*   **Creatine Kinase (CK)**
    *   Interference from adenylate kinase (AK): AK catalyzes the conversion of ADP to ATP, which can interfere with CK assays
    *   Use inhibitors of AK to minimize interference
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)**
    *   Inhibition by phosphate: Phosphate is a product of the ALP reaction and can inhibit the enzyme
    *   Use optimized substrate concentrations to minimize inhibition
*   **Amylase**
    *   Interference from chloride ions: Chloride ions are required for amylase activity, but high concentrations can inhibit the enzyme
    *   Maintain appropriate chloride concentrations in the assay
*   **Lipase**
    *   Requirement for colipase: Colipase is a cofactor required for lipase activity
    *   Ensure adequate colipase is present in the assay
