# Disease Correlation {-}

Understanding how lipid tests connect to specific disease states is vital for effective diagnosis and management. Lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides, play a critical role in various physiological processes. Abnormal lipid levels are associated with several disease states
*   **Key Conditions**
    *   Atherosclerosis
    *   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
    *   Hyperlipidemia and Dyslipidemia
    *   Metabolic Syndrome
    *   Acute Pancreatitis
    *   Lipoprotein Disorders (e.g., Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Tangier Disease)
    *   Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

## **Atherosclerosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium, and cellular debris within the walls of arteries, leading to plaque formation and narrowing of the arterial lumen
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   Elevated LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C): > 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L)
    *   Elevated Non-HDL Cholesterol: > 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L)
    *   Elevated Apolipoprotein B (Apo B): > 130 mg/dL
    *   Low HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C): < 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L)
    *   Elevated Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]: > 30 mg/dL or > 75 nmol/L
*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Elevated LDL-C and non-HDL-C contribute to lipid accumulation in the arterial wall
    *   Low HDL-C impairs reverse cholesterol transport, reducing the removal of cholesterol from the arterial wall
    *   Elevated Apo B indicates an increased number of atherogenic particles
    *   Elevated Lp(a) promotes thrombosis and inflammation
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most cardiovascular diseases
    *   Early detection and management of risk factors are essential to prevent or slow disease progression

## **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** {-}

    *   Elevated Non-HDL Cholesterol: > 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L)
    *   Low HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C): < 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L)
    *   Elevated Triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)

*   **Disease State Correlation**
    *   Abnormal lipid levels contribute to plaque formation and narrowing of the coronary arteries
    *   Elevated Lp(a) increases the risk of thrombosis and acute coronary events
*   **Clinical Significance**
