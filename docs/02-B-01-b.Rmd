# Physiology {-}

Protein and nitrogen balance is essential for health. Abnormalities in protein metabolism can lead to a variety of disorders

## **Normal States** {-}

*   **Nitrogen Balance:** Intake of nitrogen equals excretion of nitrogen
*   **Normal Protein Synthesis and Degradation:** Balanced synthesis and degradation of proteins
*   **Normal Amino Acid Levels:** Appropriate levels of amino acids in blood and tissues

### **Nitrogen Balance** {-}

*   Nitrogen balance is a state in which the amount of nitrogen consumed (primarily as protein) equals the amount of nitrogen excreted (primarily as urea)
*   **Positive Nitrogen Balance:** Nitrogen intake exceeds nitrogen excretion, indicating net protein synthesis. This occurs during growth, pregnancy, and recovery from illness
*   **Negative Nitrogen Balance:** Nitrogen excretion exceeds nitrogen intake, indicating net protein breakdown. This occurs during starvation, severe illness, and trauma
*   **Factors Affecting Nitrogen Balance**
    *   Dietary protein intake
    *   Hormonal status (e.g., growth hormone, insulin, cortisol)
    *   Illness and stress
    *   Physical activity

*   Protein synthesis is regulated by:
